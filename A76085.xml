            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I was a priſoner in the Northern parts, and firſt heard of the miſerable diſtractions and great diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were amongſt Chriſtians in <hi>London,</hi> and in all the Eaſtern, Weſtern, and Southern, parts of the Kingdome, about Religion, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; and ſaw the great rejoycing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies at it, as who hoped by this meanes to facilitate their way of attaining to their deſigne, which was to make themſelves our maſters, and all the people their ſlaves. I conceived that it was but a meer fiction, and that indeed there had been good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt the brethren, as having all joyned in a ſolemne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which ought never to be forgotten, againſt all Popery and the Prelaticall party, for the upholding of the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that they had been ſo really united together in love and affection one towards another; and in ſo ſweet an harmony amongſt themſelves, that all the enemies of the truth and of our Country, could never have raiſed any diſcord, or made the leaſt jar or breach of friendſhip amongſt them. But not many weeks after having received certain Intelligence from good hands, that there was indeed a reall rent and diviſion amongſt thoſe, that were and had formerly been beſt affected to Reformation, it did not a little perplex me, knowing very well the danger of diviſions, and the evill conſequences that would enſue, if they were not timely prevented. And after that I had informed my ſelf what
<pb facs="tcp:158558:4"/>the ground of the difference was, <hi>viz. About Independency,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my ſelf unto ſuch as were permitted to come to me, (as they can witneſſe) that as I conceived that opinion to be a meer novelty, ſo it tended to nothing but to diſtraction, and making of a breach in Church and State; and thought withall that it was brought about by the ſubtilty of the Prelaticall and Jeſuiticall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for this very purpoſe, howſoever the diſſenting parties diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the craft of the adverſaries. And I promiſed then, if ever God gave me liberty, though for my own particular I wholly diſſented from the Independent brethren in their Aſſertion, yet I would uſe my beſt diligence to moderate between them, that if it were poſſible I might make up all breaches amongſt brethren that they might the better unite all their Forces for the common defence. But the Independent brethren hearing that I was for the Presbytery againſt their tenents, after they had uſed ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I have ſet down in the inſuing diſcourſe, to diſwade me from writing about that ſubject, or at leaſt that I would ſtand Neuter; and perceiving that I would not be ſilenced; of friends they all became my enemies, and fell into open hoſtility (at leaſt in words) againſt me; ſo that I could not enjoy the very Laws of civility in many of their Companies, and abuſed me with ſuch reviling language, as would be above beleefe to recite them all; amongſt other of their expreſſions, they affirmed that I was the greateſt Incendiary in the Kingdome, and that they would prove it, and that I was an Apoſtate, and that now I had forgot my own ſufferings, and the kindneſſe that had been ſhewed unto me by the godly party; and of a ſufferer was become a perſecuter of the Saints, &amp; many words of contumely and diſgrace they daily utterd againſt me, and for no other cauſe but that I diſſented from them in opinion, and that I profeſt it was not for the ſafety of the Church and Kingdome to tollerate all Religions: for I never wronged any of them in word or deed. So that they gave me juſt occaſion then to ſuſpect, though I knew there were many truly fearing God in that number, yet that the Religion of many of their leaders was but a meer faction: and I had very good reaſon for this my conceipt, as the following diſcourſe will more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: for I never yet thought that true Religion conſiſted in word and tongue, or in opinion; but in rightly believing, and in conſcionably and duly practiſing what God in his holy Word
<pb facs="tcp:158558:4"/>hath taught unto his people, which is, to lead <hi>a godly, righteouus, and ſober life,</hi> and to live in charity and amity amongſt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to ſhew love unto all for the better winning of them; and to follow Chriſt in doing and ſuffering, to whoſe example all Chriſtians muſt conforme themſelves if they will be his Diſciples and partake with him in his glory; and as they muſt ſet Chriſt before them for imitation, ſo they muſt be obedient likewiſe to his commands who hath enjoyned all his followers to love one another, telling them that by this it will be knowne that they are his Diſciples if they love one another. Now although I heard often of the Independents New-lights, I ſaw none of their new lives: for I well perceived they had no great regard to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt of mutuall loving their Brethren, which he had ſo often inculcated upon all Chriſtians, and that upon the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from them in their new and fond opinions of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they forthwith proclaimed us all enemies of Chriſt and his kingdome, and diſavowed all communion with the Brethren in holy things, and would neither admit our children to baptiſme, nor our ſelves to the Sacraments with them, but ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from us; and in moſt odious Pamphlets laid all diſgrace upon their Brethren, dehorting their followers from reading our books, or hearing of our godly Miniſters, and declining all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us, and rather joyning with the common Enemy; all which their proceeding made me think that their religion was but faction, and that now there was no place left for a Moderator amongſt them, and that All art of perſwaſion would be thought but a flattery or cowardize; and hearing and ſeeing alſo how ſlight opinions they had of indifferent men, and how they onely made uſe of a moderation for the ſtrengthning of their party, I then gave my ſelf really to diſcover the frauds and juglings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Miniſters; and all to ſee that if by this means when their falcaies were once diſcovered, the truth might more ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear, which would the better make way for a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, if any thing may undeceive a poor deluded multitude. And ſo well acquainted I was with the language of many of them, as I eaſily diſcerned that if they could but once make a party ſtrong enough, they would then give lawes to all men: and for the ſtrengthning of their faction in the meane time, they pleade for a tolleration of all Religions; an opinion, though pleaſing to the
<pb facs="tcp:158558:5"/>fleſh, yet ſo diabolicall, as I wonder any Chriſtian truly fearing God ſhould ſo much as open his mouth in defence of it; or that any Chriſtian truly fearing God can with patience heare ſuch Beaſts plead for a tolleration, it being a thing ſo abominated by God himſelf, and ſo odious to all the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And yet notwithſtanding this is the doctrine of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents for the ſtrengthning of their party; and they abuſe Scripture for this purpoſe, and uſe many impious and vaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for this very end, to ſome of the which I have anſwered in my former Book: and the chiefeſt of thoſe that I ever yet ſaw are in a railing Pamphlet ſet forth againſt M. <hi>William Prynne</hi> Eſq; called, <hi>The falſehood of M.</hi> William Prynnes <hi>truth triumphing in the antiquity of Popiſh Princes and Parliaments.</hi> In the which Treatiſe, amongſt many things againſt all authority and power of Parliaments, which I leave to the conſideration of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the kingdome, whom it moſt nighly concernes: he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleads for a toleration of all Religions, and to that end ſets downe ſix <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi> (as he tearms them) <hi>which do neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompany perſecution for cauſe of conſcience</hi> (for all oppoſition of error is perſecution with theſe men, though they oppoſe truth it ſelfe for the maintenance of their novelties) the which his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities I ſhall ſet down forthwith in order, and anſwer them ſeverally, after I have made my juſt defence againſt ſuch of their calumnies as are worthy the taking notice of: as for ſome of their ſcurrilous reproaches, all men that are honeſt and know my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation can teſtifie the contrary, and therefore I ſlight ſuch things as ſavouring of nothing but rancour and venome, which they accuſed me of before they had ſeen my book. But whereas they calumniate me as the greateſt Incendiary of the Kingdome, they moſt ſhamefully abuſe me, and I have been freed from that reproach by both Houſes of Parliament, who adjudged all my ſufferings unjuſt, as againſt the law and liberty of the Subject. And if it were a thing that could be any way uſefull unto me. I could prove by the teſtimony of many of the brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army, who in great aſſemblies did acknowledge, when I was a priſoner amongſt them, that I had great injury done me. Yea the Papiſts themſelves have often averred it, that never any Subject ſuffered more unjuſtly then I did, in that I was caſt in priſon and fined, for maintaining the Prerogative Royall of the
<pb facs="tcp:158558:5"/>King againſt the Pope; and for defending of that Religion which was eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of the Land: and further added, that had any Catholick writ as well in defence of their Religion, as I did for the maintenance of the Proteſtant Profeſſion, he ſhould have been ſo farre from ſuffering for it, as they would not only greatly have honoured him, but alſo highly have rewarded him for his endeavour; and this that I now write I am able to prove by a cloud of witneſſes: and my unjuſt ſuffering in their opinion, made me finde more favour amongſt all the Governours that were Papiſts (which I doe ever acknowledge for a ſingular curteſie from them) then ever I found from Proteſtant Gaolers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas the Independents do accuſe me for the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary of the kingdome, all men may ſee, they ſpeak as untruly, ſo moſt malitiouſly. For it is well known, till I declared my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting opinion from them, I was much magnified by moſt of them, though now they have other thoughts of me; and accuſe me, not only to be an Incendiary, and that my Book deſerveth to be burnt by the hand of the common Hangman, but that I am a man craſed in my braine. But whereas they reproach me that I am an Apoſtate, this, all that know me will free me from: yea, the very Browniſts and Anabaptiſts will be my witneſſes, beſides my former writings, which have been ſet forth to the view of the World: for all men know that an Apoſtate is one that either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth his Generall or Captaine, and fals to the Enemy; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his Religion, and oppoſeth that way he hath formerly made profeſſion of; both which rather agreeth to many of the Independents then to my ſelf, as the enſuing diſcourſe (I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident will ſufficiently declare.) And now that I may ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my education, which many at this inſtant in the City, and them men of emunency, can witneſſe for me, that have known me from my childe-hood. At ſixteen years of age, after I had, following the cuſtomes of youth, ſpent my tender dayes in the pleaſures of Hawking and Hunting, I was ſent by my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kindred to a Village in Eſſex called <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> under the Miniſtery of that learned and reverend Preacher Mr. <hi>Richard Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> who writ that divine Book called, The ſeven Treatiſes: by whoſe means, under God, I came to the knowledge of the truth, and to that learning that God hath given me: for he out of his tender love unto me, took me into his Family, and in a ſhort time
<pb facs="tcp:158558:6"/>by the rare dexterity he had in educating of youth, being a brave Scholar, and one of the beſt Latiniſts of the Kingdome, (through the bleſſing of God upon his endeavour) made me fit for the Univerſity, in which ſpace he had an eſpeciall care to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon me well in all the principles of the true Proteſtant Religion. And as his whole life was a preaching, he ſo inſtructed me, as before my departure from him, I was able to give an account and reaſon of my hope, to any that asked me of my Beliefe. And in all his Miniſtery, doctrine, and preaching, he ſwarved nothing from the doctrine received in all the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, as thoſe in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the point of the Sabbath, and ſanctifying of the Lords day; of which (to his honour be it ſpoken) he was a diligent obſerver; ever teaching and urging upon the people the holy and religious keeping of that day; which to ſay the truth, is one of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt means of upholding piety and godlineſſe: &amp; as in his doctrine, ſo in his example he went before all the people in a ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that day, imploying it only in the duties of piety and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, alwayes either in praying, or preaching, or catichizing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of his Sermons, or in meditation, or in viſiting the ſick, or relieving the neceſſitated. And in this faith I was inſtructed, and in this, through the grace of God I now ſtand firme; and in the which by Divine aſſiſtance I ſhall ever perſevere to the laſt period of my life; never as yet having ſwarved from thoſe principles, notwithſtanding all oppoſition. And from under this reverend mans miniſtery and preaching I went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where by his means Dr. <hi>Chudderton</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge (in which I was a Studient) a man of fame for piety, in his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, took me into his own tutering, and pleaſed to make me his companion (an honour that many of my betters enjoyed not) and he alſo had as great a care to further me in thoſe principles of Religion I had formerly been indoctrinated in, as any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving could have. And from him I went into the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> where I lived four years and a halfe in the Univerſities of <hi>Leiden</hi> and <hi>Franeker;</hi> and halfe that time in the houſe of reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Amiſe;</hi> who pleaſed ſo highly to honour me, as he likewiſe made me his companion, and was a moſt painfull Tutor unto me, and added greatly by his learned Lectures, and private communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to the confirming and ſtrengthning of me, in all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:158558:6"/>orthodox truths I had formerly been inſtructed in. And from thence I went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where there were as learned and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Miniſters (ſave only in the point of the Sabbath, in which I ſhall ever diſſent from them) as any in the world. Now I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have deſerted my Generall, the King of Saints, and King of Kings, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>Julian</hi>-like apoſtated from my Captaine, or from my Chriſtian religion; nor never have ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any opinion in doctrine, that is imbraced or believed in the Reformed Churches, or taught by the orthodox and learned Miniſters of the Church of England; or from any opinion that I made publick profeſſion of, or ever pleaded for or perſwaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imbrace; the God of Heaven and my conſcience bearing me witneſſe, and as all that know me can teſtifie, as many that are now Independents have done. And therefore they deale moſt injuriouſly with me, and unchriſtianly, to call me an Apoſtate, and only becauſe I oppoſe their Independency. Now whereas they ſay, that I have forgot that I was a ſufferer, and remember not the former kindneſſes ſhewed unto me by the godly of the Land, and that I am now turned a perſecutor; they do me in this alſo a great deale of wrong: for I have never forgotten any kindneſſe ſhewed me by any, as the following diſcourſe will ſufficiently ſhew: Neither have I forgot that I was a ſufferer, or am now a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the Saints (as they calumniate me) though I ſhall ever oppoſe all Hereſies and novelties in Religion in the very Saints, as <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed <hi>Petes</hi> error, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. when he temporized, and did not walk uprightly; and deſire all Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Parents, and Maſters of families, and all good people to do the ſame, becauſe I have been a ſufferer for the Truth. But it ſeemeth ſtrange to me, that the Independents ſhould uſe ſuch an Argument to me, That I ſhould not oppoſe all Hereſies and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in Religion, and exhort all other good Chriſtians to do the ſame, becauſe I have been a ſufferer for the Truth. One would think that this ſhould rather be a motive and incitement to put me on to oppoſe all error, becauſe I have ſuffered for the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for if that be a good reaſon to deter men from defending of the Truth againſt Errors and Innovations in Religion, becauſe they themſelves have been ſufferers for Religion, then <hi>Elias, Eſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and all the holy Prophets ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred to oppoſe all Errors, becauſe they had been perſecuted for
<pb facs="tcp:158558:7"/>the Truth, and ſuffered at wicked and ungodly mens hands for it; and yet they notwithſtanding were the more encouraged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt all the falſe Prophets and Teachers of their times, as all the Scripture of the Old Teſtament witneſſeth: and Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and all the bleſſed Apoſtles who ſuffered grievous perſecutions; ſome of which were whipped in every good Towne they came in, and were ſtigmatiz'd, and gloried that they carried the marks of the Lord Jeſus about them. And all theſe therefore, by this Argument of the Brethren, ſhould have been afraid and diſcouraged to oppoſe the Errors, Hereſies, and novelties in Religion in their dayes: whereas on the contrary we finde that Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and all the Apoſtles, ever oppoſed the Errors, Schiſmes, and Hereſies of their times, with all the falſe Teachers; calling them <hi>A generation of Vipers Wolves in Sheeps clothing, ravinous Wolves, Children of the Devill, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the croſſe of Chriſt, Dogs, evill workers, them of the Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Hereticks,</hi> and wiſht that they were cut off; and give them ſuch odious names, as there can be no more reproachfull utter'd: The ſame did all the holy Prophets; and yet all theſe were ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: The ſame did <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zwinglius, Bullinger,</hi> againſt all the Sects of their times, and yet they were all perſecuted by the Papiſts. And therefore it is not a diſhonour, but a praiſe to all thoſe that love the Truth and have ſuffered for it, ever to oppoſe all Errors in Religion: yea, it would argue great cowardize and baſeneſſe in any Chriſtian, or at leaſt, that he were now very cold in Religion, that would not ſo much as open his mouth in defence of that Truth he had formerly ſuffer'd for, for feare of offending men. And if this Argument be of any power to diſſwade any man from oppoſing errors in Religion becauſe they have been ſufferers for it; then the Independents themſelves ſhould not ſo bitterly inveigh againſt thoſe Tenents they count Errors: for they brag much of their ſufferings alſo, &amp; cry out daily of Perſecution, when notwithſtanding no man troubles them; howſoever they with all reviling ſpeeches daily perſecute their brethren under the name of Presbyterians: But, I ſay, if this Argument will make any thing againſt me, to diſſwade me from defending of the truth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting all good Chriſtians to oppoſe all Hereſies and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion: why then do the Independents in all their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and in all their ſcurrilous and blaſphemous writings oppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:158558:7"/>the Truth it ſelfe: and why doe they for the ſetting up of their New-lights, and for the bringing in of their own Traditions and Novelties, perſecute their brethren with all injurious languages, worſe then ever <hi>Iſhmael</hi> uſed towards <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi> towards <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> and proclaim them all enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and perſecutors; for they alſo have been ſufferers, and that eminent ones, and have undergone great perſecution for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they publiſh to the world in their writings? If it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable therefore, and praiſe-worthy in the Independents to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Truth, notwithſtanding they have been ſufferers? will any rationall man count it an intolerable thing in me, to oppoſe the errors and novelties of the Independents, which they would impoſe upon the people of God, as his lawes, (when they are but their own inventions) and as things neceſſary to ſalvation? And will any reaſonable creature call this a perſecution in any, if in his own perſon, to the uttermoſt of his abilities he labours to defend the truth, and convince error, and exhort all thoſe that fear God to do the ſame becauſe he hath been a ſufferer? I conceive upon deliberation he will have a more charitable opinion of ſuch an one. And if this be a crime in ſuch as have ſuffered for Religion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Error? the Independents are guilty of the ſame as deeply as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; for they alſo ſhould remember they have bin ſufferers; &amp; yet they maintain their Novelties for truths, and exhort all their followers to do the ſame, and to oppoſe all gain-ſayers, which they do to the uttermoſt of their power in words and deeds, and count this their honour and a great virtue, yea valour, and yet blame it in me and in all the Presbyterians; and I know no reaſon why I, or any Presbyterian ſhould not be as valiant for truth, as others ſhould be for the upholding of their errours and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecialiy when they fly ſo high in their Expreſſions, as to make them the onely way to heaven, and that whoſoever is not in that their way, they are in the broad ſtreet to perdition; and exclaim againſt all ſuch as oppoſe their opinions as perſecutors of the wayes of God, for this is their uſuall dialect; yea, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary language and cuſtome, to call all writing and preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Errors and Hereſies of the time, Perſecution, in all the faithfull Miniſters and people; which duty notwithſtanding they are bound unto by Chriſt, and all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, who are by them commanded to lift up their <hi>voyces like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:158558:8"/>to oppoſe and rebuke all gaineſayers, <hi>and to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> And this is the language of that Author, that writ the <hi>Arainment of Perſecution,</hi> and he that writ that malicious Pamphlet againſt M. <hi>Prynne;</hi> who calls him, and all the Presbyterians, Perſecutors; whoſe wicked and vaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, by which he laboureth to prove the neceſſity of a tolleration of all Religions, are theſe following. His words are theſe. <hi>Six impoſsibilities which do neceſſarily accompany Perſecution for cauſe of conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>It is impoſsible that the Gospell ſhould come to be preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, if men may be queſtioned for matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>It is impoſsible that ſuch as know but in part, ſhould grow in knowledge, or from one meaſure and degree of Faith unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>It is impoſsible that in a rationall way there ſhould be a firme ſecure peace throughout the World, nay, not in a Province, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Towne, ſo long as men may make a point of conſcience to compell one another to their opinions.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>It is impoſsible to preſcribe ſuch a way for ſuppreſsing new and different opinions whatſoever, which to any State or Church may ſeem Hereticall, but there will ſtill be left a gap, a poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of fighting againſt God, even when ſuch State or Church think they fight for him moſt of all.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>It is impoſsible that either the weak Believers, miſ-believers, or unbelievers, can be wonne by our godly converſation, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.12. <hi>and</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>and</hi> 1 Cor. 7.12.16. <hi>ſo long as we will not ſuffer them to live amongst us.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>It is impoſsble for a man to hold faſt the truth, or be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his owne heart of what he does, of what Religion he makes choiſe of; unleſſe after he hath ſearched the Scriptures, and tryed the spirits whether they be of God or no, it be lawfull for him to reject that which ſhall appear to him as evill, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to that which ſeems good in his own judgement and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are the formall words of the Author that writ that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, by which he endeavours to maintaine that helliſh opinion, The tolleration of all Religions. To the which I ſhall briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, after I have ſet down ſome teſtimonies out of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning Perſecution.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:158558:8"/>
            <p>Yet before I go any further, I deſire all men by the way to take notice, that whiles I labour to ſhew the vanity and invalidity of this Cavillers aſſertions, I animate no man to perſecute the truth: For I know that perſecution of the true Religion is the greateſt ſin in the world (one only excepted:) and therefore that all men ſhould ever be carefull to offend in this kinde, leſt they bring ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtruction upon themſelves by it: but they muſt alſo be as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to take heed, leſt whiles they would ſhew a vice, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not their duty and decline a vertue; which is to oppoſe all errors and falſehood in Religion: for that is as great a ſin on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. But now I will produce ſome teſtimonies out of holy Scripture, and reaſons from thence; to ſhew, that to be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for matters of conſcience or perſecution (as they call it) for cauſe of conſcience, impoſes not an impoſſibility (as they would infer) that the Goſpel by this meanes ſhould be preached unto all Nations, nor hinders not the growth of grace in Chriſtians, nor the meaſure and degrees of faith in them, which is the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of theſe Propoſitions; and the which, to ſpeak the truth, are the main and chiefeſt of all the Independents Arguments, by which they labour to evince the neceſſity of a tolleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions (that prodigious Tenent) leſt forſooth, otherwiſe the courſe of the Goſpel, and the increaſe of grace in the Saints ſhould be hindred if men ſhould (as they pretend) be perſecuted for cauſe of conſcience, which is no better, then whiles they ſeeme to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, to blaſpheme, and to give Chriſt and the Spirit of God the lye, who teach the contrary; and to fight againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and truth it ſelf, as will by and by appear. Firſt therefore, I ſhall deſire, that Chriſts own words may be heard; and then what the holy Apoſtles have ſpoken concerning theſe points. Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17, 18, 19, &amp;c. ſpeaking to his Diſciples, ſaith, <hi>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the Councels, and will ſcourge you in their Synagogues, and ye ſhall be brought to the Governours and Kings for my ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles; but when ye are delivered, take no thought how and what ye ſhall ſpeake, &amp;c. For the Brother ſhall betray the Brother to death, and the Father the Sonne, and the Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents, and ſhall cauſe them to dye: and yee ſhall be hated of all men for my Name ſake, but he that endureth to the end, he ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 21.12, 13. our Saviour ſaith
<pb facs="tcp:158558:9"/>there to his Diſciples, <hi>Before all theſe they ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the Aſſemblies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſons; and bring you before Kings and Rulers for my Name ſake; and this ſhall turn to you for a teſtimoniall.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 15.20. Chriſt ſpeaking to his Diſciples, <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the word I speak, to you, the Servant is not greater then his Maſter; if they have perſecuted me, they will perſecute you alſo, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 16. verſ. 1, 2. <hi>Theſe things have I ſaid unto you, that ye ſhould not be offended, they ſhall excommunicate you: yea, the time ſhall come, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſervice.</hi> So that the preachers of the Goſpel, muſt expect all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, not only from open enemies, but from ſuch as ſeem to be of the ſame Family, and the very Pillars of the Church. And in <hi>John</hi> 20.18. he foretelleth <hi>Peter, That howſoever when he was young he went whether he would, yet when he was old he ſhould be be led whether he would not.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 13. verſ. 9. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perſecution for the cauſe of Chriſt is preached unto all the Apoſtles, where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They ſhall deliver ye up to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and to the Synagogues; and ye ſhall be beaten, and be brought before Kings and Rulers for my ſake for a teſtimony unto them.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. verſ. 15.16. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Ananias, go thy way, for he is a choſen veſſell unto me,</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to beare my Name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; for I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my Names ſake.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Chap. 3. verſ. 2, 3. ſending <hi>Timothy</hi> to comfort them <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the faith,</hi> that no man ſhould be moved by their afflictions and perſecutions, gives them his reaſon why they ſhould be of good courage, and endure them patiently; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto; ſo that every one that will be Christs Diſciple, must denie himſelfe, and take up his croſſe daily and follow him, Luke</hi> 9.23. he muſt look for and expect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for it. And in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Thou haſt known</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>my perſecutions and afflictions which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but from them all, the Lord delivered me: yea, all that will live godly in Christ Jeſus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable places to this purpoſe might be produced, out of all which, this truth may evidently be gathered, for the comfort of all Gods people, and ſuch as ſuffer perſecution for his names ſake,
<pb facs="tcp:158558:9"/>That it is the will of God, that they ſhould ſuffer for the Goſpel; and that they are called upon this condition, to endure affliction and perſecution, as being one of the meanes and wayes God uſeth to bring them to life eternall and endleſſe glory; the knowledge and hope of which, ſupporteth them in all their tribulations and perſecutions: As is evident in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. And therefore from this apparent truth, and from all the places above ſpecified, I gather theſe two concluſions. The firſt, <hi>That perſecution or queſtioning any for conſcience ſake, impoſes not an impoſſibility, that by this means the Gospel ſhould be preaced to all Nations.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That the queſtioning of any for matters of conſcience, inferres not an impoſſibility, that ſuch as know but in part, ſhould grow in knowledge, or from one meaſure and degree of faith unto another,</hi> as that Author in his firſt aſſertions falſely affirmeth. And for proof of my firſt concluſion, and the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his firſt Poſition, the foregoing places abundantly declare it; for the Apoſtles were to be haled before Kings and Rulers for this very end, That they might give witneſſe unto the Goſpel; and by that very meanes that the Goſpel might come to be preached and publiſhed to all Nations, for ſo Chriſt aſſerteth: and when he told <hi>Ananias</hi> in the ninth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that he had choſen <hi>Paul</hi> to be a veſſell to carry his Name to the Gentiles, and before Kings; in the words following he ſignifieth by what meanes he ſhould carry his Name before the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and Kings, and that was by his ſufferings and perſecutions; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my Names ſake:</hi> for he being in all places whereſoever he came queſtioned for his conſcience, was committed to priſon as an evill doer, and haled before the Tribunals of the Rulers and Kings of the Earth; by which meanes he had an opportunity to preach unto them the Goſpell of JESUS CHRIST, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith and repentance, which he did before <hi>Foelix,</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Feſtus;</hi> and after, before <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to whom for juſtice he appealed as his ſupreame Judge on earth; And to many mighty men, Princes, and Nobles beſides, and to many other people out of all countries that frequent Kings Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Courts of judicature, to learn knowledge and wiſdome, and to get experience; ſo that his perſecution and queſtioning for matters of Religion and conſcience, were ſo farre from
<pb facs="tcp:158558:10"/>hindring the courſe of the Goſpell, as it greatly promoted it, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it will appear: for had not <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles been haled before Rulers and Governours for their conſcience, they ſhould never have had an opportunity or any occaſion to have come into their preſence: and therefore Chriſt that knew the beſt way of proclaiming the glad tydings of peace to all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, made the cruell perſecution of the Adverſaries, the very way of promulgating the Goſpel to the whole World; and ſo by his infinite wiſdome brought good, the ſalvation of his people out of their evill: And to ſpeak nothing but what all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, both ancient and moderne, relate; this hath ever beene Gods method, by the perſecution and ſcattering of his people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, to make his Name known through the whole Earth. And all men may know that have read the Hiſtories of thoſe times, that the haling and citing of <hi>Luther</hi> before the Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> for matters of conſcience and Religion, was one of the chiefeſt means of propogating the Proteſtant profeſſion through all thoſe Weſterne Countries: for his ſtout defending of the truth there againſt <hi>Ecchius,</hi> and his undaunted behaviour in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Goſpel, made the World take notice of it; and by this his publick witneſſing for the truth, it came to be divulged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where: whereas, if he had never been queſtioned and called before the Emperour, there is little probability that there would ever have been any notice taken of it by the great men of the World. But when they perceived that the mighty Princes of the Earth thought his Doctrine worthy the regarding, the Nobles and Peers of Kingdomes alſo, then began to liſten after it. The ſame may be ſaid of all the former Chriſtians and Martyrs in Ages paſt; and of all our glorious Martyrs here in <hi>England;</hi> ſome of which were haled before King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and others in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, before all the Tribunals, before the Judges and Rulers of the Land: by which means, as they gave evidence unto the truth, and ſealed it with their blood; ſo it was one of the principall cauſes of firſt propagating the Proteſtant Religion through the Kingdome, and of afterwards eſtabliſhing of it here: whereas, if they had never been queſtioned for their conſciences, by all likelyhood, it would only have remained in ſome corners of the Kingdome, and in ſome private Families; and never have been publickly authorized. For the confirmation of all I have
<pb facs="tcp:158558:10"/>now ſaid, the places above cited, and Chriſts own words, might ſufficiently evince. But it will not be amiſſe, to hear <hi>Pauls</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning this point; whoſe witneſſe I conceive is more to be credited, then all the Independents put together, much leſſe then this Bablers. He in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 9. ſpeaking by the Spirit of God concerning perſecution, ſaith, <hi>Wherein I ſuffer trouble</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as an evill doer unto bands, but the Word of God is not bound:</hi> and in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 4. verſ. 7. <hi>The Lord ſtood with mee and strengthned mee, that by mee the preaching might be fully known, that all the Gentiles might heare, &amp;c.</hi> Out of the which words we may obſerve two things. Firſt, that the Apoſtle ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his conſcience, not for evill doing. Secondly, that his ſuffering notwithſtanding, hindred not the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to all Nations: for he himſelf affirmeth the contrary, ſaying, That by his bonds the Word of God was <hi>not bound;</hi> and by this his queſtioning and perſecution, the preaching of the Goſpel was made fully knowne, that all the Gentiles might hear, &amp;c. I refer it therefore to the judgement of any learned and intelligible man, whether we ought rather to believe the Spirit of God ſpeaking in <hi>Paul,</hi> or this Chatter of uncircumciſed ears and lips? And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23. ſaith, <hi>And now behold I go bound in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto Jeruſalem: not knwing the things that ſhall befall me there, ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> The ſame alſo was foretold unto him by <hi>Agabus</hi> in Chap. 21. verſ. 11. Yet <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds, neither in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, nor in any other City, and his being queſtioned for matters of conſcience about the Reſurrection, before <hi>Foelix,</hi> King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Feſtus,</hi> hindred not the propagation of the Goſpell to all Nations, as this Jangler would infer: for <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the contrary in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 12, 13. <hi>But I would ye ſhould underſtand Brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>that the things that hapned unto me</hi> (ſpeaking there of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) <hi>have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpell; ſo that my bonds for Chriſt are manifeſt in Caeſars Court, and in all other places.</hi> By this teſtimony alſo of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is evident that the perſecution for cauſe of conſcience, rather furthereth the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell to all Nations, then hindreth it; as is yet more manifeſt through the whole ſtory of the <hi>Acts;</hi> as for one inſtance, chap. 8. verſ. 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>That they that were ſcattered
<pb facs="tcp:158558:11"/>abroad, went every where preaching the Word.</hi> And all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hiſtories teſtifie the ſame: ſo that by this that I have now ſaid, and many more evidences that might be produced, it is clear, that perſecution for cauſe of conſcience impoſes not an impoſſibility, that by it, the Goſpel ſhould be preached to all Nations. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is the Bellowes of the Goſpell, driving every ſpark of truth into a flame. So that all judicious men may ſee the vanity and invalidity of this Cavillers firſt aſſertion. And this ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken of that.</p>
            <p>Now I come to prove my ſecond concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for cauſe of conſcience, hindreth not the growth of grace and knowledge in the Saints: yea, it is ſo far from hindring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from growing in knowledge, and from one meaſure and degree of faith unto another, as this fond Babler in his ſecond aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion would inferre, as it every way improves their graces and knowledge; as we may ſee in thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. concerning ſome of which the Lord giveth this teſtimony, verſ. 34, 35, &amp;c. <hi>Who through faith quenched the violence of the fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſſe were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the Aliens. And others were tortered, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtaine a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſurrection. And others had triall of cruell mockings &amp; ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings; yea, moreover of bonds and impriſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawne aſunder, were tempted, were ſlaine with the ſword: they wandred about in Sheepskins and Goatskins; being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: of whom the world was not worthie: they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in Deſerts, and in Mountains, and in Dens and Caves of the Earth; and all theſe having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promiſe, &amp;c.</hi> All theſe thrived rather by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and perſecutions, and increaſed in grace, and out of weakneſſe were made ſtrong, if we may believe the Scripture. The ſame is alſo affirmed concerning afflictions &amp; perſecution for conſcience ſake, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword (as it is written, for thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as ſheep to the ſlaughter) nay, in all theſe things, we are more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, through him that loved us.</hi> By this witneſſe of the Apoſtle, perſecution which has been the lot of the Saints <hi>all the day long,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:158558:11"/>that is to ſay, in all ages, is ſo far from hindring the increaſe of grace, and the degrees of faith, that it <hi>makes them more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, through him that loved us.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> writing to his counntrey men, that by perſecution were ſcattered and diſperſed, through <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithinia,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame; who in chap. 1. verſ. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. ſaith, <hi>That they were kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time; wherein</hi> (meaning perſecution) <hi>ye greatly rejoyce,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>though for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſſe, through many temptations; that the triall of your faith being much more precious then that of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, who having not ſeen, ye love; in whom, though now ye ſee him not; yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glorie, receiving the end of your hope, even the ſalvation of your ſoules.</hi> And in chap. 3. verſ. 14, 15. <hi>But if ye ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>happie are ye, and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled: but ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready alwaies to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reverence.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1. verſ. 27, 28, 29, 30. incouraging the <hi>Philippians</hi> in their perſecution, ſaith, <hi>Let your converſation be as becommeth the Gospel of Chriſt: that whether I come and ſee you, or elſe be abſent, I may heare of your affaires, that ye ſtand faſt in one spirit with one minde, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel: and in nothing terrified by your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of ſalvation, and that of God: for unto you it is given in the behalfe of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake, having the ſame conflict which ye ſaw in me, and now here to be in me.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> animates the Chriſtians in thoſe times to ſuffer cheerfully; telling them that it was a great honour to them, and the gift of God to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake. That therefore which is one of the eminenteſt means of the increaſe of the graces of God, and the degrees of faith, and the gift of God, that cannot hinder the growth of them: but to ſuffer perſecution for Chriſts ſake, is one of the eminenteſt means of the increaſe of the graces of God, and of the degrees of faith, and is the ſpeciall gift of God. <hi>Ergò,</hi> perſecution cannot hinder the growth of the graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Saints.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:158558:12"/>
            <p>And for proof of this the teſtimony of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in chap. 5. verſ. 10. ſufficeth. <hi>The God of all grace,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who hath called us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his eternall glory by Christ Jeſus, after ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, strengthen, and ſettle you.</hi> So that by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> teſtimony, perſecution for conſcience ſake, and for Chriſts cauſe, <hi>doth perfect, stabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle men:</hi> it is a means to increaſe all the graces of Gods Spirit, and therefore hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not their growth. And in the Chapter going before, verſ. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Beloved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall, as though ſome ſtrange thing hapned unto you; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Christs ſufferings: and if ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happie are ye: for the Spirit of glorie and of God resteth upon you:</hi> Here is a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of graces by reaſon of perſecutions: <hi>for the Spirit of glory and of God reſteth upon ſufferers by them.</hi> And therefore in the concluſion of his ſecond Epiſt. ſpeaking to his countrey men ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here and there through perſecution; <hi>Grow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in grace, and in the knowledge of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this Gentlemans ſecond aſſertion be true, <hi>That it is impoſſible that ſuch as know but in part, ſhould grow in knowledge, or from one meaſure of degree of faith to another, if men ſhould be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for matters of conſcience:</hi> which are his expreſſe tearms. Then the exhortation of <hi>Peter</hi> to thoſe that were under perſecution, that they ſhould be alwaies ready to give an anſwer of their hope; and that they ſhould grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, were to no purpoſe. And all that he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Epiſtles, concerning their growth in all the graces of the holy Spirit: and all that <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 1. touching the benefit of perſecutions; and the good that redounds not only to thoſe by them that ſuffer, but to all the Saints; who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their example, more willingly to endure affliction: and were thereby the more ſtrengthned, &amp; got the more increaſe of all graces by them: and whatſoever S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 1. concerning the Chriſtians growth in patience and faith, through the perſecutions and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they then endured for conſcience ſake; and whatſoever he hath teſtified to the contrary in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in all his other Epiſtles; and whatſoever the whole Scripture hath evidenced in this behalfe, concerning the growth and increaſe
<pb facs="tcp:158558:12"/>of all the graces of Gods Spirit, by reaſon of their perſecution, for conſcience ſake, and for Chriſts cauſe; all theſe witneſſes I ſay ſhould be nothing; yea, untrue, and meer falſehood, if this Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers aſſertion be true: yea, all the Independents themſelves ſhould be notorious lyars if theſe Poſitions be veritable: for they brag ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly what increaſe there is daily of the Independents, and of all their graces; and what abundance of New-lights do daily appear by reaſon of their perſecution (for ſo they pleaſe to ſtyle every oppoſition of their errors) and glory in all companies where they come, what multitudes have lately joyned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their New wayes, by reaſon of the oppoſition of it; and for that ſome of their Leaders have been queſtioned before the Committee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of conſcience: and this that I now ſay, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an <hi>Iliad</hi> of witneſſes. So that I refer it to all judicious men, whether we ought to believe Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in all the Penmen of the Scriptures, who aſſert, that perſecution for religion &amp; conſcience, increaſe the graces of God in Chriſtian ſufferers, or this wretched and temerarious Novice; who boldly and impudently dares give the Spirit of God the lye, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the whole Scripture; and which is much, oppoſe all the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the Independents: For this man affirmeth, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that men ſhould grow in knowledge, or from one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of faith to another, if they be perſecuted or queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for matters of conſcience. And yet the Spirit of God ſaith the contrary, and the experience of all the Saints confutes this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. And if the Independents themſelves may be believed, they alſo refell this Poſition, boaſting daily, not only of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their graces by oppoſition and queſtioning, but of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the mighty multitudes of them by reaſon of that. So that every one of but ſhallow capacity may ſee the vanity of this Juglers two firſt concluſions. For the four other following, they are anſwered in this that I have now ſaid. Yet a word or two more, to ſhew the nothingneſſe and wickedneſs of them, will not be amiſſe. For whereas he boldly affirmeth, <hi>That it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that in a rationall way there ſhould be a firme ſecure peace through the World, nay not in a Province, City, or Towne, ſo long as men make a point of conſcience to compell one another to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</hi> This I aſſert is, to confute Gods own Word in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. who hath commanded there, that whoſoever ſhould teach a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:158558:13"/>Doctrine to that that was taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and ſuffer death for it; and that by this means a firme peace would be ſetled amongſt Gods people, &amp; through their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for as idolatry and errours is a cauſe of Gods wrath, and by that a cauſe of all troubles; ſo the removing of the cauſe is the way to ſettle the peace of Kingdomes. And if we reade the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Judges, and indeed all the Prophets, and holy Scriptures, we ſhall finde the not queſtioning and bringing of the Seducers and falſe Prophets to condigne puniſhment, was the cauſe of all their captivities, and of all the warres and troubles the Iſraelites were continually imbroyled with. And therefore they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the holy Scriptures, may eaſily ſee the falſity and impiety of this aſſertion: to ſay nothing what all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and the Stories of all Ages relate, of the continuation of peace in all thoſe Nations and Kingdomes, as long as men were both queſtioned and puniſht for bringing in of Hereſies, and teaching of falſe doctrines; and as long as they preſerved the truth of Chriſtian doctrine amongſt them, which no ſooner begun to be corrupted, and errors ſet up, but immediately upon it, Gods wrath was kindled againſt thoſe Kingdomes and Countries: and if we will give credit unto the Word of God, and to the Annals of times, the ſuffering and tollerating of errors in religion amongſt them, was the cauſe that the Lord was angry with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved at laſt their Candleſticks from them, as we may ſee at this day in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and all the Eaſterne and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Churches: and if we will not ſhut our eyes, we may ſee alſo, it has been the cauſe of all theſe miſerable diſtractions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that now theſe three Kingdomes are involved in; which if they had eſtabliſhed the Goſpell in its purity, and kept out Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all Hereſies, wickedneſſe, and Schiſmes, we ſhould not have thus been afflicted on every ſide at home and abroad: for the neglect of our duties in not keeping out of errors in religion, hath brought down all theſe judgements upon us: and therefore the tollerating of them all would much more increaſe our miſery, and diſturbe the peace both of the Cities and countrey; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſuch as plead for a tolleration of all religions, ought to be ſpued out of the Kingdome, as prophane and impious men. And this ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken of this third aſſertion, which is indeed to make war againſt God himſelf, and not againſt us
<pb facs="tcp:158558:13"/>only. For the fourth, where he ſaith, <hi>That it is impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch a way for ſuppreſſing new or different opinions whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which to any State or Church may ſeem hereticall, but there will still be left a gap, a poſſibility of fighting againſt God, even when ſuch State on Church think they fight for him moſt of all.</hi> This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition alſo is not only contrary unto the Word of God, but indeed overthroweth all authority; and by this, no juſtice ſhould be done againſt any blaſphemous Seducers, or againſt any impious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in points of Religion, or againſt ſuch as offend againſt the Lawes of Kingdomes and Nations; becauſe for footh by doing of their duty, which God requires at Magiſtrates hands, <hi>there will ſtill be left a gap and a poſsibility of fighting againſt God:</hi> as if to do good, and that which God enjoynes them, would leave open a gap and a poſſibility of fighting againſt God. I have read, That we may not do evill that good may come of it; I have alſo read, that God can create good out of evill, and bring light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but I have never read in the Word of God, That Chriſtian Magiſtrates and Rulers ſhould be deterred from doing their duty, &amp; ſuppreſſing of Schiſmes, Errors, and Hereſies; becauſe through the wickedneſſe of men, and the craft and ſubtilty of Satan, there may ſometimes troubles immediately ariſe to any Nation by it: All good Magiſtrates are to do their duty, and what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and leave the ſucceſſe to God; and to commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their endeavours to the Lord, who hath a recompence of reward in ſtore for them for their well doing; and ought not to be deterred from their duties by ſuch poor cavils as theſe, which are both impious and ridiculous. And whereas in the fifth aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he affirmeth, <hi>That it is impoſsible that either the weak believers, miſbelievers or unbelievers, can be wonne by our godly converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is required,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. and 3.1, 2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12, 16. <hi>So long as we will not ſuffer them to live amongst us.</hi> What is this, but openly to fight againſt Gods Word, and God himſelfe. Who <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. and in many other places of Scripture, commandeth that Secucers ſhould be put to death, and exterminated and caſt out from amongſt Gods people, whoſe wicked converſation would corrupt others; and be ſo far from winning weak Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, miſ-believers, or unbelievers, as it would make them all worſe and worſe, and utterly vitiate all the places they dwell in, as daily experience teacheth us, and as the Scripture affirmeth;
<pb facs="tcp:158558:14"/>which aſſert, that <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> verſ. 6. As for the places of Scripture, he there citeth, as they make nothing for his purpoſe, ſo they ſufficiently ſhew that he is a meer ſtranger in Divinity; and in the Word of God, as I could evidently make appear if I ſtudied not brevity. And it might alſo be made evident, that the baniſhments and perſecutions of many of Gods people, as well as their preſence and co-habitations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wicked, have been the cauſe of many thouſand mens converſions; who ſeeing men willingly to relinquiſh all earthly things, and leaving their own countries and nigheſt relations for their religion, made others the more to look into that doctrine, and to enquire after that religion, that men for the love of, would loſe all things; yea, liberty and life it ſelfe; which, I ſay, hath been the cauſe of the converſion of many thouſands: ſo that not only the preſence but the abſence of men is the cauſe of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers converſion, by which the vanity of this aſſertion is alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemes ſtrange to me that this wrangler ſhould uſe this Argument to prove a Tolleration of all Religions, when the practiſe of the Independents is contrary, who caſt all that are of a different opinion from them, out of their Congregations: and where they have power in their hands, baniſh them from amongſt them; and yet here in <hi>England</hi> they would have all Religions tollerated to do miſchiefe, when Saint <hi>John</hi> notwithſtanding in his 2 <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Elect Lady, forbids her, and in her all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>to receive falſe teachers into their houſes, or ſo much as to bid them God ſpeed, leſt they that shall ſo do, partake with them in their evills;</hi> by which doubtleſſe he never gave a tolleration of all Religions: but as I ſaid before, it is well known that people are converted many times, as well by the abſence of men, as by their preſence, whether it be for errour or for the Truth: for by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the cauſe of it, and why they were baniſhed, they come to the knowledge of the truth and errour, and ſo to ſhun the one and love the other.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the ſixth and laſt. <hi>It is impoſsible for a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to hold fast truth, or be fully perſwaded in his own heart of what he does, or what Religion he makes choice of; unleſſe after he hath ſearched the Scriptures, and tryed the Spirits, whether they be of God or no, it be lawfull for him to reject that which shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb facs="tcp:158558:14"/>to him as evill, and adhear to that which ſeemes good in his own judgement.</hi> In a word, by this mans Divinity, without there be a tolleration of all Religions, and that it be left arbitrary for every man to take and chooſe what Religion he pleaſeth, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to hold faſt the truth; for this is his meaning: now if this be good doctrine, then the devill is a good teacher, for this came from hell: but becauſe this his Poſition hath the greateſt appearance of reaſon of all the reſt with the ſimple people, who much conſide in the ſtrength of it; it will not be amiſſe to ſay ſomething to it, although with any rationall men, if it be well conſidered and weighed, it can never infer a neceſſity of a tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Religions, an opinion ſo hetrogeniall to the holy Scripture, and ſo contrary to piety: for the Word of God which muſt be the rule of our faith, in diverſe places declares Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of all ſtrange opinions and doctrines, commanding all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people to cleave <hi>unto the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> Eſa. 8. <hi>And that they ſhould teach no other doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. <hi>And that they should take heed of fables, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 4. That is, of mens inventions: <hi>And that they ſhould hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And if any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſome words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſſe, that they ſhould withdraw themſelves from ſuch,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.5. <hi>And that they ſhould hold faſt the faithfull Word as they have been taught, Tit.</hi> 1.9. <hi>And that they should rebuke men sharply, that they may be ſound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewiſh fables, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, that turn from the truth, ver.</hi> 13.14. <hi>And that they ſhould not be wiſe above that which is written,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And that whoſoever teacheth a contrary doctrine tending to ſeduction, ſhould be put to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. All this the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth in numberleſſe places. Now then when Chriſtians know the good will and pleaſure of God, and are likewiſe taught out of the Word of God, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. And in divers other places, that it is their duty that they ſhould bring up their children and families in the nurture and fear of the Lord, and inſtruct them in the knowledge of his Commandements, that is, that they ſhould educate them according to the Will of God, and in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, as <hi>Timothies</hi> grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother did him from his child-hood: I ſay, when all
<pb facs="tcp:158558:15"/>Chriſtian Parents bring up their children, and indoctrinate their families after this rule and manner, they may hold faſt the truth very well, and be fully perſwaded of it in their own hearts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they never ſo much as hear of any Hereſie, or of any ſtrange opinion. For as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Ye erre not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. So that the knowledge of the Scripture it ſelf, is able to keep all men from error, as teaching the <hi>way, the truth, and the life, &amp;c.</hi> And as all wilfull ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is both ſinfull and blame-worthy amongſt all good men, ſo there is a learned neſcience, which is as commendable, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is vituperable: and that is, when men deſire not to be wiſe above that which is written (for ſo they are commanded) ſo that the underſtanding of that which is written in the Book of God, and to <hi>know God to be the only true God, and him who he hath ſent, Jeſus Chriſt, which is life eternall, Iohn</hi> 17. This is the only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge neceſſary to ſalvation: and all this a man may learn and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to, without a tolleration of all Religions, which they call liberty of conſcience, which is a moſt irreligious opinion, and no way beſeeming a Chriſtian: for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt depart from evill,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Now tolleration of all Religions is ſuch an evill, as there cannot be a greater, and more diſpleaſing to God; for it is a very fighting againſt God. And for that liberty of conſcience the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, it is no other, then that all Chriſtians are now freed from the yoak of all legall Ceremonies, and traditions, and inventions of men, and from the curſe and rigour of the Law: but from that liberty to infer a tolleration of all Religions, is moſt impious and abſurd: and it is as wicked to conclude, that we are not tyed to the obedience of the Law, both Morall and Evangelicall; for this is againſt all the tenure of the holy Scriptures, and againſt all ſound reaſon, as will by &amp; by appear. And therefore all Chriſtian parents ought to inſtruct their children and houſholds in the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, as they will anſwer it before God at his dreadfull Tribunall. And if their children will not by kindneſs be induced and brought to that that is good, they are to be forced to it by the Rod and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo inſtructeth all Parents in diverſe places of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And it was the ſinne of old <hi>Ely,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. that he did not chaſtize his children, and ſeverely puniſh them for their wickedneſſe, and force them to obey the commands of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:158558:15"/>this was the cauſe of the Lords diſpleaſure againſt him, that he caſt off his Family from being Prieſts, and removed the place of his worſhip from <hi>Shilo,</hi> to teach all Chriſtians to take heed by his example; ſaying, <hi>I will honour them that honour me, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed of.</hi> So that to ſee ſinne and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in children, and to connive at them, and not to puniſh them for it, is <hi>to deſpiſe God.</hi> And therefore they ought to force them to obedience, unto that religion God hath appointed; and if they will yet perſevere, and continue to be rebellious againſt God and their Parents, they are to be cut off by the Law of God. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here muſt be forced, the Will of God muſt be obeyed (there is no diſpenſation given to tranſgreſſion, or to commit evill, though good might come of it:) and that Will and good pleaſure of God, we have ſet downe clearly and evidently in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. The knowledge of which is enjoyned to all Chriſtians, as neceſſary to ſalvation. But for all vaine opinions and new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and traditions, and inventions of men, under the name of New-lights, if a man never hears ſo much as the mention of them, he may very well go to Heaven, <hi>and hold faſt the truth, and be fully perſwaded in is heart of the truth of his religion:</hi> and this truth the Word of God holdeth out, to all thoſe the god of this World hath not blinded their eyes, that they ſhould not ſee the glorious Light of it: ſo that there needs not a tolleration of all Religions for their illumination to finde out what Religion they will make choice of, as this preſumptuous gain-ſayer infers, who peremptorily concludes, <hi>That it is impoſſible for a man to hold faſt the truth, or be fully perſwaded in his own heart of what he does, or of what religion he makes choice of,</hi> unleſſe it be left arbitrary to him to reject or chuſe what ſeems good to him in his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which if it be not a piece of blaſphemy, I never read any, or any thing more tending to the overthrow of the authority of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and to ſubject the Will and pleaſure of God, to the will, pleaſure, and judgement of man, then the which there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be nothing more intolerable: for God teacheth us one thing, and this Doctor teacheth the clean contrary: and by his doctrine, leaves not only a gap, a poſſibility of ſighting againſt God, but it is a doctrine in it ſelf, that fights againſt God, <hi>and gives the Spirit of God the lye,</hi> which confirmes the contrary. And if ſuch doctrines as theſe may be tolerated, and ſuch Teachers as theſe go unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:158558:16"/>they will in time reject the whole Scripture, both Law and Goſpell; as many of the Sectaries have already attempted to do, to the unſufferable diſhonour of God, and to the provoking of his diſpleaſure againſt the whole Nation. And ſuch doctrine as this is, is hereticall, and ſo is a great deale more of the Independent doctrine: which is one of the reaſons which makes me ſo much oppoſe it. For as the falſe Teacher <hi>Acts</hi> 15. verſ. 1. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>taught the Brethren beſides the Goſpell, that except they were circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, they could not be ſaved,</hi> which was a Hereſie: and that that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, told them, would exclude them out of Heaven, as is evident, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. verſ. 2, 3, 4. So now the Independent Miniſters impoſe their own inventions and traditions upon the people, as things neceſſary to ſalvation, which makes it a Hereſie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they preach up their own novelties as neceſſary to life eternall, proclaiming unto the people that their way is the ſtraight way to Heaven, and that they that are out of it are in the broad path to deſtruction (as can be proved by a cloud of witneſſes, and indeed their daily practiſe teacheth it) and when they urge this doctrine upon the people as neceſſary to happineſſe; I affirme it is an hereticall doctrine, and ought of all Gods people as much to be deteſted as any Popery: for it is Popery it ſelf in new clothes, which all the faithfull in the Land have taken a covenant to expell: and ſo much the more they ought to have a ſingular care that this doctrine ſpread not too far, nor that this Faction get not a Head: For I heard it not long ſince from the mouth of a very godly Gentlewoman of a good Family, who affirmed it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an Independent Miniſters Wife, That to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there was an hundred pound at one time ſent up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or at leaſt procured to be paid by ſome from <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the gratifying of ſome here, that were very great Sticklers and Promooters of the Independent party, for their farther incouragement; and animated them by any wiſe to uphold that faction, for they conceived it would be one of the beſt means for the attaining of their own ends and the common deſign, for the ruin of us all, and the enſlaving of the whole City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Now I ſay if this Independent Doctrine be ſo prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to us all for ſoul and body, and ſo dangerous in every reſpect, it concernes not onely the Parliament and great Councell, but the
<pb facs="tcp:158558:16"/>whole City and Kingdome to looke about them, and take heed how they have their hands in ſupporting of it, or any way how they ſoment it, as they tender either the glory of God, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or future good of ſoul or body, of this Nation, and the good of the Church and State. And truely if there were nothing to bring a man into a deteſtation of their wayes, but their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe unto their brethren, it were enough to make any good chriſtian diſlike them, for they never ſpeak of them but with contumelious names, and with vilifying and blaſting language, ſuch as is too low for any people of virtue, reputation, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; uſing to call them all at every word, the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, Presbyterian Perſecutors, dehorting people from hearing our Godly Miniſters, or for reading any thing written by them or any other, againſt their opinions, (after the manner of the Jeſuits) ſlighting the moſt learned Preachers, and their Orthodox writings as things of nothing, ſaying that every boy and ſilly woman in their Congregations, can anſwer any thing any Presbyterian can write; and then ſet one or other of their confounded widdows, or ſome ſuch creature, upon that imployment, who ſcrible non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe as familiarly as a Jackanapes cracks nuts; and this is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amongſt all the Independents, as an incomporable peece; and their authorities are often cited in the Pamphlets of their learned Miniſters. Neither is it among themſelves onely that they count all the Presbyterians the children of the Devill, but publikely alſo and that in preſence of Noblemen and Peers of the Kingdome, and in the hearing of many Gentlemen of the Parliament and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in their very Companies they can ſlight all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the Land beſides themſelves: for I being not many dayes ſince at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where there was a Sagomore of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents amongſt ſome honourable company, I formerly mentioned; and I taking an occaſion to ſpeak to him about Independency, and the Noble man alſo ſpeaking to him about it, and others, in the preſence of them all he uttered theſe words, <hi>That all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Kingdome, and all ſuch as were well affected to Religion, were of that way;</hi> and this I ſay he ſpeaks in the hearing of them all, to which the Nobleman and one of the Parliament men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; Then it ſeems, ſay they, that all that are not Independents, in your opinion, are neither godly nor well affected to Religion: and ſo the Noble man departed the roome, and left the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<pb facs="tcp:158558:17"/>there. Now if this their opinion of themſelves be not a moſt Phariſaicall proud, and uncharitable one I leave it to the judgement of any adviſed Chriſtian, ſo that they cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their brethren with any love, who they think ungodly and men not well-affected to Religion, and in their writings call the profeſt enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and enemies of his kingdome; and therefore if they do not change their opinions and alter their judgements, all the poor Presbyterians may expect leſſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from them then from the common enemie. And if due no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be taken of all their conſultations and of their buzings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and their juglings, they tend to no other end, but to make their partee and Faction ſtronger, as within theſe few dayes, they in the contriving of a Petition to the Parliament, would have made it one of their requeſts to the Honourable Houſe, <hi>That the Aſſembly of Divines might have been diſmiſt, and ſent every one of them to their particular charges;</hi> but that ſome of more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thought it unſeaſonable, and therefore put it out, and other things of high nature are ſpake of, that they would have inſerted into their ſupplication, all making for the corrobarating of their partee: for if the Aſſembly were but once diſſolved before there be any Government ſetled, and if the lights were taken away, then what would not theſe men do in the dark, amongſt the ſimple people, who by their craft they make beleeve any thing? and who labour by all their power and wit, out of the hatred they have to all the Presbyterians, to make them odious, and their Government deteſtable to the people, and perſwade them that the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans way is worſe then that of the Pope, and the moſt tyrannicall that ever was, and profeſſe they will fight to the laſt drop of their blood, before they will be ſubject to them.</p>
            <p>And this that I now ſay, I ſpeak upon very good ground, for I know their indignation and cauſe-leſſe malice againſt all the Presbyterians, and I have heard great words from them, when they took me for one of their number, what they would do if they were forced to it: and the truth is, among thoſe they think they may confide in, they affirm they will not be beholding to the Parliament nor any body elſe for their liberty, for they will have it and aske them no leave; they have the ſword now in their hand and they thinke their partee ſtrong enough to encounter any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and oppoſing partee, and they profeſſe they care not how
<pb facs="tcp:158558:17"/>ſoon they come to cutting of throats, and ſpeak of nothing but the ſlaughtering and butchering of the Presbyterians: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is juſt cauſe given us to think we may expect better quarter from the very enemies, then from the Independents, who call us in their Pulpits Brethren, but in their hearts hate us and our government, and alwayes magnifie their own, and endeavour to eſtabliſh it and their own Religion; which if it were once tollerated, what ſafety would there then be for the Presbyterians; yea, what comfort can any take in this world to live amongſt ſuch, who think little better of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren then of Infidels, and ſeparate themſelves from us and our Aſſemblies, as from a company of Dogs and Swine, and ſo call us: and profeſſe that they are reſolved all to dye for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, meaning Independency, before they will ſubmit themſelves to the Presbyterian government: but they ſhould call to minde it is not the puniſhment but the cauſe that makes the Martyr; it muſt be ſuch a death as ſeals Gods truth, and not mans inventions and traditions that will be accepted; leſt it be asked another day, who required theſe things at your hands: let them therefore try firſt how their religion is bottomed, for ſuch as ruſh themſelves upon needleſſe danger, under pretence of Religion, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Devils Martyrs: but ſure I am they are none of Gods Martyrs that ſuffer for a Religion of their own making: and ſuch are all the Independent novelties: and amongſt other of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, this of a toleration of all religions. But they ſhould alſo conſider, that if they were in a good cauſe, as they are not, and ſhould offer to be burnt for the true Religion, yet if they have not love and charity towards their Brethren, this ſacrifice would do them no good; nor be no more accepted of God, then that of <hi>Cain,</hi> if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may be believed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. verſ. 1.2. And therefore before they go to that Altar or any other, I would wiſh the Independents to lay down their gift, and firſt to renounce their hereſies, novelties, and their blaſphemous tenents, and all their uncharitableneſſe, and come and be reconciled to their Brethren, and to the Church of England their Mother, from which they have made ſo ſhamefull a defection; and in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they have by their wantonneſſe in opinions, cauſed ſo fearfull a rent, that they have cauſe to repent and mourne for it all the dayes of their lives; and then they may have comfort if they be forced to ſacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:158558:18"/>for religion, or otherwiſe they will have no comfort. And if no Art of perſwaſion can prevaile with them to bring them to unity; I ſhall deſire then, if there be any bowels of affection to their Wives, Children, and Families, or if there by any love to their Country, or any deſire to live in love and unity, with thoſe that are as dearly beloved and as truly the people of God as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: that now all by-reſpects being laid aſide, and all prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate opinion caſt away, they would againe return into the boſome of the Church and make up all breaches, and joyn both their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their ſtrength with us, againſt the common enemies both of our religion and countrey. But if our Brethren ſhall forget all the Lawes of nature and humanity, and the law of God, and will unreaſonably perſevere to trouble the Church and State. I know not but the Magiſtrate may not only lay commands upon ſuch to be ſilent, but alſo ſeverely puniſh them for their contumacy, if they refuſe to obey. All which I ſpeak not to tolerate perſecution as I ſaid before; which I know is ſo heinous a ſin, as there is but one greater: but only to ſhew the vanity of theſe mens proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who endeavour indeed to overthrow the authority of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates under pretence of liberty of conſcience; as if it were not lawfull in them to <hi>puniſh buſibodies and evill doers;</hi> when as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1 Epiſt. chap. 4. verſ. 15. bids all Chriſtians take heed they ſuffer not under that notion. And it is a vaine thing in any men to pretend conſcience for religion, when under that colour they have baſe and wicked deſignes, as to make a faction, and to bring in a tumultuation both in Church and State. And therefore as we are taught by the good will and pleaſure of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. how greatly it diſpleaſed him, <hi>That his people left the fountaines of living waters, and digged themſelves Sisternes that could hold no water.</hi> So out of the ſame Word of God we are taught, that all Chriſtian Magiſtrates who are <hi>the Miniſters of God for the good of his people, and who are no terrour to good workes, but to the evill;</hi> have the ſword committed unto them, as is evident through the whole Goſpell: and in the thirteenth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in both the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and that of Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> in all which ſuch as ſpeak <hi>evill of dignities, and deſpiſe their authority,</hi> are reckoned amongſt the worſt of men: and out of that Word of God we are alſo taught that Chriſtian Magiſtrates are <hi>Custodes utriuſque tabulae:</hi> for God
<pb facs="tcp:158558:18"/>that gave the Law to Fathers &amp; Mothers, Maſters of Families, and Magiſtrates, commands them all, that they ſhould take a care and ſee that all thoſe under their ſeverall charges ſhould keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord, as is manifeſt <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. and many other places of holy Scripture, might he produce to that purpoſe, and that they ſhould all ſee to bring up <hi>their Children in the nurture and fear of the Lord,</hi> which they cannot do if they or any of them give a tolleration of all Religions. And Chriſt himſelf the Lawgiver ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19. <hi>Thinke not, that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill: for verily I ſay unto you, till heaven and earth paſſe, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law, till all be fulfilled. Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt of theſe Commandements, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven; but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, ſhall be called the greateſt in the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Now it is moſt evident by all that Sermon, that Chriſt ſpeaks of the Morrall Law, and ratifies it with all its ſanctions and puniſhments annexed to it againſt the violators of that his Royall Will; and by the Law and Prophets and by the Goſpell, he hath confirmed all Chriſtian Magiſtrates in their Authority, and by all them hath taught all his people that the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in all reſpects under the Goſpell, is as great and as ample if not more extenſive then it was under the Law. So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by the Law of God or Nature, deſerved death or was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of puniſhment under the Law; the ſame deſerveth death and puniſhment under the Goſpell. And therefore as Atheiſme, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Blaſphemy, profanation of the Sabboth, and all manner of impiety and tolleration of all Religions, and all manner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe was by the Law of God to be puniſhed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates under the Law; the ſame ought by the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to be puniſhed under the Goſpell: and therefore all good and godly Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Parents, Miniſters, Maſters of Families, and indeed all ſuch as fear God, ought to joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the exterminating and rooting out all falſe worſhip out of Gods ſervice, and all manner of hereſies and will-worſhip, with all manner of humane inventions, and whatſoever <hi>conſent not to the wholſome words of the Lord Jeſus Christ, and to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is according to Godlineſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. And this is the
<pb facs="tcp:158558:19"/>duty of all Chriſtians in any authority. And truly, if ever there were a time, that call'd for an eſtabliſhment of one religion and a ſetled government, with uniformity in a Church and State, and a ſuppreſſion of all Hereſies, Sects, and Factions, now it is: when by the ſad effects already of diviſions and variety of opinions, we may well perceive what ruine will come upon the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, if there be a toleration of all religions granted. For divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and factions, eſpecially in religion, have been fatall to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Common-wealths in all Ages, as moſt Hiſtories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. And if men will not learn their duties from Gods command, nor from the example of all the holy Patriarks, Prophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that would have but one religion, then let them learn it from the Independents; who whiles they pleade for a toleration of all religions in every Nation and Countrey, will not give a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of them in their own Families &amp; Churches, nor in <hi>New-England,</hi> nor of any other but their own: ſo that any man that is not ſtupidity it ſelf, may well perceive, they ſay one thing and mean another; and what toleration of religion they would afford us if they were in authority. But this we learn, that it is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates place to execute the will of God againſt offenders, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as would bring in a toleration of all religions. And it is the duty of all Miniſters and people fearing God, and ſuch as deſire the peace of Church and State, to aſſiſt the Magiſtrates, and to oppoſe all Hereſies and Innovations in Religion; and to ſtudy every way to maintaine love and amity amongſt Brethren, which a confuſion of all religions can never do: and this I thought fit in way of Preface to premiſe in my own juſt defence; and for conviction of the blaſpemous Tenents of that Scribler, that writ againſt learned Mr. <hi>Prynne.</hi>

            <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſetting before the Chriſtians of his time the ſins of the Jewes, and their often rebellion againſt God, and how frequently they had provoked him; ſpecifies alſo, the judgements that came upon them for their diſobedience and ingratitude; and tels the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (and in them all Chriſtians) that whatſoever hapned unto the Jewes, it was for <hi>our learning, upon whom the ends of the world are come:</hi> ſo that if we take not heed by their example, and ſhun not thoſe ſinnes that they provoked God by, we ſhall likewiſe make our ſelves liable to the ſame puniſhments. And as no Nation had God ſo nigh unto them as the Jewes, nor no people upon the face of the Earth that God had ſo freely loved and miraculouſly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the hands of their enemies, when at any time under their great oppreſſions they cried unto him; and continued ſtill to be their Saviour and Redeemer out of all their captivities, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries (with the ruine and overthrow many times of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) and ſent his Prophets and Wiſe men early and late to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and teach them his Statutes and Ordinances, commanding them to ſeek the old way and the good way, that they might finde reſt unto their ſoules, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. and had in all reſpects been ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly gracious, that he himſelf ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard then that I have done?</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they <hi>left him, the fountaine of living waters, and digged unto themſelves broken ſiſternes that could hold no water. Ier.</hi> 2. So that in Chap. 5. verſ. 30, 31. the Lord ſaith, <hi>A wonderfull and a horrible thing is committed in the land. The Prophets propheſie falſely, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo: and what will ye do in the end thereof?</hi> In the which words the great ſinne of rebellion and ungratitude in that people is ſufficiently ſet down, they liſtned unto the falſe Prophets, and yeilded obedience unto what they preached unto them (the ſame complaint Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> and in his other Epiſtles
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158558:20"/>concerning the falſe Apoſtles of his time) and caſt off the Lord, and ſlighted his true and faithfull Miniſters, and ſet up their own inventions for Gods worſhip, and ſervice, and his wayes; by which they ſo provoked God againſt themſelves; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they had been the glory of all Nations, and the admiration of the world, through their often rebellions and unthankfulneſſe, they became the ſcorn of the Earth, and the hiſſing of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes round about them, and a by-word among the Heathen: ſo that the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in his Lamentations complaining of the miſerable condition in their captivity, ſaith, That never any people groaned under greater miſery, and that moſt deſervedly: for as our bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that knows his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> The people of Iſrael of all the families of the Earth, were moſt honoured by God; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the which he had extended and ſhewed his free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved favour, and betruſted them with the lively Oracles of his will: but they rebelling againſt him, and not liſtning unto his voice, nor yeilding obedience to his commands, but giving eare to falſe Prophets and vaine deluſions, and ungratefully and undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully behaving themſelves towards him, and alwayes reſiſting his Spirit; the Lord did often more ſeverely afflict them then any other Nation, and at the laſt caſt them off, as the dung and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the world, ſo that they are at this day the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable people on the Earth, and an object of pity and of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all ſuch as truly wiſh their converſion. And all this evill is come upon them for their rebellion and ingratitude, as the whole Scripture relateth; and to teach us, on whom the ends of the world are come, to take heed by their example; leſt provoking God as they have done, we partake not of the ſame plagues. And truly, if we do compare Nation with Nation, and take notice of Gods gracious dealing toward the Jewes, and of his fatherly and favourable dealing towards us, there is not a people under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Jewes only excepted, that God has done more for, then this our Nation. So that the Lord may ſay unto us, as he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people the Jewes, <hi>What could I have done more to my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard then that I have done?</hi> And yet there is not a people under the Heavens more like the Jewes in their rebellions and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a heavenly Father, then this Nation hath been and now is: ſo that we may cry out with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

And even as they rebelled againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> their deliverers, and told them to their face, they took too much upon them, and that they were all a holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were ſoon weary of him; and deſired rather to be at their Onions and Fleſhpots againe in Egypt, then to be fellow-commoners with Angels; and wiſhed rather to be under the tyrannicall government of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his cruell Taskmaſters, then under the ſweet yoak of God and the government of his ſervants <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who they moſt reproachfully abuſed and rebelled againſt; and were ever mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring upon all occaſions againſt their deliverers, and only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe accidentally they met with ſome difficulties, and groned under ſome preſſures, notwithſtanding they were but temporary and for a time, as it happens in all alteration of governments and reformations. After the ſame manner is our dealing at this day generally towards God, and towards our <hi>Moſeſes</hi> and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who riſe early and ſit up late, &amp; go through the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the cold of Winter, and eat the bread of carefulneſſe, and watch for our good that we may ſleep in quiet: and yet the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly out of covetouſneſſe and prophaneneſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of faction and ſtudy of novelties, moſt ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and abuſe them both in word and deed, as all their carriage doth daily manifeſt, and their ſcurrelous and railing Pamphlets declare; by which they ſhew their unthankfulneſſe to their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verours, and their ungratitude to God himſelf, to the provoking of his wrath and jealouſie againſt a Nation unworthy to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Not ſeven years ſince, the whole Kingdome lay under ſuch intolerable preſſures both for ſoule and body, and had to do with ſuch unreaſonable Judges in all Courts, as no man could either ſerve God or the Devill for them, but he was puniſhed for it: ſo that there was not any through the whole Dominion that could promiſe himſelfe ſafety from oppreſſion a moment, or ſay any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158558:21"/>thing was his: <hi>For they made a man an offender for a word, and laid a ſnare for him that reproved in the gate, and turned aſide the juſt for a thing of naught, Iſay</hi> 29.21. <hi>And truth failed, and he that departed from evill made himſelf a prey, Iſay</hi> 59.15. So that this Nation was every way in as miſerable a condition as the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites were, under their tyrannicall Judges: ſo that the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubjects were the chiefeſt objects of their greateſt cruelty, though none were free from it if they had any eſtates, that their oppreſſors might inrich themſelves by them: they were all tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over both for ſoule and body, as the whole Kingdome can witneſſe. And then we cryed unto God and he raiſed us up delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers from abroad and at home; and freed us by their meanes from the unſupportable cruelty of our Taskmaſters, both in Church and State; and from the ſlavery and unjuſtice of all their tyrannicall Courts, and from the whole yoke of the Hierarchy; and ſet up the Ordinances of God in ſuch purity, and made ſuch a bleſſed Reformation, as our forefathers would have rejoyced to have ſeen but the half of it, and enjoyned alſo the ſanctifying of the Lords day: neither did our Deliverers reſt here and were now ſatisfied with what they had done, but they endeavoured alſo to ſet up ſuch a Church-government as Chriſt the King of his Church hath appointed: ſo that if we had but thankfull hearts to God and our deliverances, and could diſcern what God had done for us by them, we might be the happieſt Nation under Heaven. But on the contrary, and contrary to our Covenant and Proteſtation (I mean not the Proteſtation proteſted) thoſe that have deſerved beſt from us, we think worſt of; and thoſe that a few years ſince there was nothing thought too good for, nor no entertainment too little for, nor no praiſes ſufficient to extoll them with; as our Brethren in Scotland, the Parliament it ſelfe, our brave Generals and Commanders, all the diligent and painfull Miniſters of the kingdome (as they all deſerved) they are all now murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were by thoſe Bricklayers, as ſoon as they were delivered from their fiery furnaces; and with them we deſire to returne into Egypt, and wiſh our old Maſters againe, and think their tyranny a good government: and all this is done not by the Malignants and the ordinary Proteſtants only, but by thoſe that ſeem the greateſt promoters of reformation, &amp; ſuch as would be thought the only Chriſtians &amp; Saints, as they term themſelves,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158558:21"/>bidding all others depart from them, as being more holy than they: and flye in the very face of one of thoſe men, who they had with ſingular encomiums a few years ſince magnified as one of the worthies of the kingdome, and predicated as one of the witneſſes ſpake of in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and whom they had received in his return from baniſhment with their acclamations of joy; I mean that learned Gentleman Maſter <hi>William Prynne</hi> Eſquire, my brother in afffiction and fellow ſufferer, who is now the ſame that ever he was, and one that for the teſtimony of Jeſus, I am moſt confident, would dare to ſuffer more then many that now traduce him; dare thinke. And if any fiery tryall ſhould indeed really come, he would, (I doubt not) undauntedly ſtand in the defence of truth, when they would flye and take their heels as formerly they have done; or ſqulke in holes, or play leſt in ſight, or temporize, howſoever they now vapour when there is no danger: yet of this very man whom they idolized before, they now ſpeak of, as of one inſpired with the devill, and as of a man of no religion, and profeſſe that they are ſorry they ever prayed for him; and wiſh that when he had loſt his eares, he had loſt his head; and athouſand ſuch expreſſions they dayly utter, and not only againſt all thoſe I have above ſpecified do they vent their paſſion by their railing lauguage, but they abuſe any man whatſoever, that oppoſeth their Novelties, although they had never ſo honourable thoughts of him before, &amp; conceived never ſo well of him for his godly life, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their unconſtancy, and the ficklenes of their unſtable minds; ſo that we have juſt cauſe to remember that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help: his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh:</hi> So unſtable creatures are men, won with an apple and loſt with a nut, imitating the Jews, one day crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and another day crucifie him; one day with the fooliſh <hi>Galathians,</hi> they would put out their eyes to do <hi>Paul</hi> good, and another they counted him their enemy. But what I pray is the cauſe of this their ſo great diſpleaſure, againſt our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt the Parliament, againſt our noble Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, againſt all the godly, learned, and painfull Miniſters of the Kingdome, and againſt Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> and indeed againſt all their faithfull brethren, for they rail and murmur againſt all, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158558:22"/>thoſe of their own faction, as it is well known. It is becauſe forſooth they would ſet up a Presbytery and deſire to eſtabliſh that kinde of Government in the Church, which is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (which they ſay to the precious Saints, for ſo they terme themſelves, will be more unſupportable then the Prelaticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) and becauſe they would have the people enter into a publike Covenant for the bringing in and ſetting up a through reformation; and becauſe they have appointed a ſet day of faſting and humiliation through the Kingdome (which they in no ſort allow of, becauſe, ſay they, there may be an occaſion of rejoycing that very day: and ſo there might have been a cauſe alſo of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning amongſt the Jews, at ſuch very times as they had their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſons of rejoycing and feaſting) but that is not all, why they are offended with the <hi>Scots</hi> and with the Parliament, and with the godly Miniſters, and with all their brethren; but this diſpleaſeth them exceedingly, Becauſe they have made a late Order, that none ſhall Preach publikely but ſuch as for their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and learning, and ſoundneſſe of Doctrine, are able right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſtruct and teach the people the right way both of ſerving God and obeying men, and how they may live comfortably here and be uſefull and profitable to others, and be kept from hereſies and ſchiſms, and ereonious doctrines, which tend to nothing but faction and deſtroying of their own ſouls, and the diſturbing of the Church and State, and for the bringing in of a confuſion of all Religions, and for the alienating of the affection of brethren one from another, and for the overthrowing of all order in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Villages, Towns, Cities, Countries, and Kingdomes: and for the bringing men in time, that they ſhall neither know what to beleeve nor what to practiſe, as by ſad experience we already finde to be frequent. Now becauſe our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Parliament, and the godly and faithfull Miniſters, and thoſe that as truely fear God as any of them, deſire ſuch a reformation and ſuch a Government, as by which Truth and Peace may be eſtabliſhed amongſt us; and hereſies, and ſchiſms, and factions may be rootedout, the diſturbers of Peace; that we may all live happily here and gloriouſly hereafter: This kinde of government not ſuiting with their humour, nor with their opinion, therefore they abhor it, and all ſuch as indeavour to eſtabliſh it, and deſire and wiſh rather that all the old trumpery were brought in again,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158558:22"/>and profeſſe it, that they had rather have the Government of the Prelates, then this kinde of Government; yea, ſome of them have not been aſhamed to proteſt unto ſome Malignant and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall Prieſts (with whom they can very well comply when occaſion ſerves) that before the Presbyters ſhall rule over them, they will cut all their throats, and joyn with them for there-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the Hierarchy: and this the Prieſts themſelves with great joy have related: And there muſt needs be ſome great Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity, that is not yet brought to light in theſe new facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for it is notoriouſly known to many thouſands in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the Malignants at home and abroad, as their words and Letters do declare, confide as much in theſe Sects, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto their deſignes, as they do in all the Cavaliers. So that it is high time for the great Councell of the Kingdome, and for all that love the true Religion, and wiſh the peace and welfare of both Church and State to ſtand upon their guards at home as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and to ſhew their vigilency and care for the preventing of the intended evill againſt us all. And truely it might awaken any man, if he take but notice, of the great diſtractions and of the ſad effects theſe new opinions have produced, not onely in <hi>London</hi> and in the Counties round about it, but alſo in <hi>Yorke-ſhire, Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and in all other places where they are imbraced; and how in a ſhort time Chriſtians minds are alienated one from the other, and from the Parliament, by reaſon of the difference of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to the great rejoycing of the common enemy, whoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hatred is againſt all thoſe they call round heads, that is, the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> and all the towns wherein they dwell, who are and ever were ſince the dayes of reformation, the onely upholders of the true reformed Religion, and are at this day the onely bulworks of it under God; and amongſt thoſe Towns that have kept out theſe new Factions by their care and providence <hi>Leiceſter, Darby,</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> deſerve high commendations, who through the prudence of their Miniſters and Magiſtrates, and through their own knowledge and the well-groundedneſſe of all the good Chriſtians there in their Religion, have hitherto kept out all manner of Schiſms and Factions, where the poor people (to their immortall honour be it ſpoken) under all their ſufferings by reaſon of the common calamity, ſerve their God night and day with the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and live in love and amity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158558:23"/>amongſt themſelves without any variance, and in the midſt of war; and in theſe diſtracted times enjoy peace one with another, and ſubmit themſelves with cheerfulnes &amp; without repining at all Ordinances of Parliament, for the Common good and ſafety of the Kingdome; and are moſt active &amp; conſtant friends to the uttermoſt of their power, yea above their abilities, unto the Parliament. And becauſe they are ſo unmoveable in their Religion, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their ancient integrity, after the manner of the old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans of <hi>England,</hi> they are more hated by the Cavaliers then any other towns, and by all the Noveliſts: for all the old Puritans and them they call Presbyterians, are equally hated by both: yea this is generally obſerved; That all Papiſts and prophane perſons in generall, and all Sects whatſoever, although they diſagree amongſt themſelves, and differ in their manners, opinions, and affections too, one from another as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did, yet to perſecute Chriſt, as they did then agree; ſo all theſe Sects can accord and joyne together in a common amity, and with the Pontificians and Malignants, perſecute the Presbytery which is next unto the Word of God, an Argument to move me, to beleeve that it is Gods Ordinance, becauſe it is ſo hatefull to all men; for as our Saviour ſaid of his Diſciples, <hi>That they ſhould be hated of all men for his names ſake,</hi> ſo generally all Gods conſtitutions finde little favour amongſt all ſuch as leave the high way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and follow the by-way of errours and Novelties, and continue in the pathes of irregeneration or new-fangleneſſe, the ſin of theſe times: when Hereſie is Religion and Schiſm the beſt trade in the Kingdome, and the onely way of preferment. And truely the contemplation of the change of all mens minds and manners, within theſe few years, and thoſe rents and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church, makes me call to minde the old plot that the Jeſuits and their complices, and all the Popiſh crew have been long a laying, and contriving for the undermining of the State and overthrowing of the true Proteſtant Religion which was <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidie &amp; impera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jeſuites had nothing more common by heart and by book, then that, the way for the alienating of theſe three flouriſhing Kingdomes to a forain juriſdiction, and for the extirpating of the true Religion in them, and reducing again of popery, and for the advancing of the Papal uſurpation, was firſt to make ſects and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158558:23"/>among our ſelves, and then to foment them by ſome of their crafty companions, who want neither wit, learning, nor induſtry; and know very well how to perſonate every man in ſaying, doing, counſelling, and complying with all ſorts of Sects, as if they themſelves were the moſt zealous defenders of thoſe conceived truths, and the greateſt abettors of them, when under that vaile they hide themſelves; and do not only maintain thoſe that are on foot, and ſuch as they have already hatcht, but daily bring forth new ones, and every one more monſtrous then other; and all this for the ſubverſion of the three Kingdomes, and the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in them, and which is the cauſe of all the calamities that are now amongſt us. But for the effecting of all this they ſeem to pretend a ſingular holineſſe and more then ordinary piety, and put themſelves therefore in ſheeps-clothing in all their actions, and plead for a chriſtian liberty: and therefore they eſpecially labour to hinder any ſetled government in the Church; but ſuch an one as they well know will bring confuſion upon us all, and which no wiſe ſtate can tolerate, and yet none but this will pleaſe their humour: and therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour principally to make odious the Presbyterian government, which the Ponteficians and all prophane men, and all Sectaries and Hereticks have ever hated; and therefore have alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make it odious to all people, as a government ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to inſlave Kings and Princes and diſtructive to all well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Common-weals and to the liberty of the ſubjects, and to the deſtroying of the Nobility and Gentry in kingdomes, and for the making of a parity amongſt all men, and a community of all things; and by this means in a ſhort time to bring in a confuſion in Church and State. And by ſuch ſuggeſtions as theſe, they have for many generations, as in theſe our times made the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hatefull to all men. And it is the ſtudy at this day of all the Malignants, and of all Libertines, &amp; Male-contents and Sectaries, and of all the Independents, to make diviſions betweene people and people, and between Nation and Nation; and to render thoſe men deſpicable that they ſeemed but a few years before highly to honour, love, and magnifie, as now they do our Brethren of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whom they ſeemed not long ſince greatly to eſteeme; and who yet ought, and that deſervedly, to be exceedingly honoured for their love to us; who expoſed their own lives and welfare,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158558:24"/>yea, their whole country to danger, for our aide, aſſiſtance, and defence; and yet theſe men now, with our Noveliſts and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable creatures, thoſe Reeds ſhaken and turned with every winde of doctrine, and every ſtreame of new opinions (as much as in them lies) are made as hatefull as any common enemies, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God and our Nation, and ſhews great unthankfulneſſe in us all, to the deterring of any Nation to come to our ſuccour or relief; and all this their malice and hatred is, becauſe they have ſet up the Presbyterian government amongſt themſelves; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the more uniting of the three Kingdomes to gather in a more nigh affection, to eſtabliſh it here; wherein they have done God and the Kingdome good ſervice, and will finde a reward in Heaven for it, if they fail of it here: and it will not be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Nation to ſuffer any black mouthes to contaminate the reputation of thoſe that have deſerved ſo well from us; and therefore all ſuch as have neither a bridle for their tongues nor their unruly paſſions, ought to have a bit put in their mouthes to teach them better manners, more humanity and gratitude. But this has ever bin the practice of all the enemies of God, &amp; his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all ages, to make all his Servants, the holy Prophets, yea Chriſt himſelf and his bleſſed Apoſtles, hatefull to the people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion of diſturbers of all Kingdomes, enemies of <hi>Caeſars</hi> and of all government. And this made the Popiſh faction in Qu. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, when they heard that thoſe Miniſters that fled out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Frankford</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and into other places, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſet up the Presbyterian government in <hi>England</hi> if the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ever came to the Crown, ſo to beſtir themſelves and ſet their wits on work, to hinder and fruſtrate that their intention: for they ſaid among themſelves, if that government were once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the Kingdome, their Catholick Religion could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get place or take rooting here any more: and therefore ſeeing they could not take away the life of that moſt excellent Lady, nor any way keep her from the Crown after her Siſters deceaſe; now all the policy would be to hinder that work. Whereupon they ſuborn'd many of the moſt famous wits out of both Univerſities, that under pretence of religion and zeale to the Proteſtant profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould flye over to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> and to the other places where thoſe Miniſters were, as if they had done it out of conſcience and pure love to the Proteſtant religion; and ſeemed in all points of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158558:24"/>doctrine to be as zealous as any of thoſe that were there, and the only deſirers and advancers of the true Proteſtant Religion: but they profeſſed unto them, that for the manner of government the Hierarchicall way of ruling the Church, in their opinion (the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of religion being once eſtabliſhed) would moſt tend to the preſervation of it, as being moſt powerfull for the ſuppreſſing of Sects and Schiſmes, and for the upholding alſo of the Kingdome; and that the Presbytery would tend to nothing but the bringing in of Anarchy: and what with their craft, ſubtilty, and wranglings (as the Independents now do in the Aſſembly) they ſo interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their proceedings, as they could not then bring their good deſigne to perfection, and ſo hindered that glorious work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation for that time, and all under the pretext of piety and good, to the peace of the Church and Kingdome. And as ſoon as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was dead, and that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was preclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Queen of <hi>England,</hi> then they all repaired home; and having a ſtrong party in the Court, all ſeeming zealous Proteſtants (though Papiſts in their hearts) they commended theſe men as wiſe and moderate men, and ſuch as were lovers of Monarchies, and regall government to the Queen, and diſgraced all thoſe that ſtood for a Presbytery, as ſuch as were factious and affectors of innovation, and ſuch as were no way to be preferred to eminent places in the Church; but becauſe as they ſaid, they had ſuffered for their conſcience, they were willing they ſhould have good Parſonages and Benefices through the Towns and Villages where they might preach to the people, but they were all ſet in the Black Bill, as men not fit to preach in Courts, and as men uncapable of great places and high promotion in the Church, &amp; were ever kept under as thoſe that were ſeditious and not fit for Eccleſiaſticall honours. And all the other that were either Papiſts in their hearts, or ill affected to the Proteſtant Religion, though ſeeming Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, were advanced to all Church-dignities, and made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, and Suffragates, Deans, Archdeacons, and the Queens and Noblemens Chaplains. And in a very ſhort time they eſtabliſhed their High Commiſſion Court, under pretence of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Popery; whereas they intended nothing, but the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in time of all true Religion; and the re-eſtabliſhing again of their old worm-eaten and rotten profeſſion. And they had in a good meaſure accompliſhed this their diabolicall plot, and had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158558:25"/>really effected it, had it not pleaſed our God to call this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Aſſembly, who by their vigilancy and care fruſtrated this their deſigne. And all this they then brought about by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Presbytery into hatred and diſgrace, as the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have often gloried and bragged among their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they would ſhew how they had ever out-witted the Puritans. And at this inſtant of time, they have their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices that foment all theſe factions, by whoſe means they labour to hinder the Presbyterian government, knowing very well, that if it ever be eſtablied, the Kingdome of Antichriſt will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get head againe amongſt us, nor none of their abominable Sects have rooting in theſe Kingdomes, but that the truth by that means will flouriſh (maugre all the maligners of it) and be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated through the world; which is the only cauſe, that not only the Devill but all ungodly men and ſtraglers, are ſo inraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Presbyterian-government, which they know is ſo prevalent for the ſuppreſſing of all Hereſies and eronious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and for the curbing of all vice, wickedneſſe, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, as that they will never be permitted to rooſt in theſe dominations. And whereas they look upon all the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as they tell us in their writings, as the enemies of JESUS CHRIST and his Kingdome; I look upon all the Sticklers againſt the Parliament and Presbytery (by what names and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſoever diſtinguiſhed, &amp; what ſeeming piety ſoever they make ſhew of) as on a company of Juglers. And truly as the Juglers in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time bewitched the fooliſh <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſo theſe by their cunning craftineſſe have infatuated too many well meaning and godly people; who, howſoever they have learned to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the very lawes of civility and common charity, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all thoſe of a different opinion from themſelves, as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt: yet I ſhall ever learne to diſtinguiſh between the people that are miſlead, and they that ſeduce them: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of many of them, as ſuch as deſire to ſerve God with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and in the pureſt way of worſhipping him: and becauſe their Teachers perſwade them that theſe their new wayes, are the wayes of God, and they not being able to diſcern truth from error, and to diſcover their hypocriſie are all deceived by them, as the poor Widows were by the Scribes and Phariſees in Chriſts time, who our Saviour ſaid devoured their houſes under pretence of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158558:25"/>long prayers: and as they brought in the leven of their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and inventions into Gods worſhip and ſervice, ſo do the falſe teachers of theſe our times bring in their own grolleries and Baggatellies, &amp; prefer their own traditions before the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, and violate all the lawes of love and charity for the eſtabliſhing of the ſame. And as ignorance in all people is the cauſe of error, for ſo our bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> ſo in theſe perilous and dangerous times, theſe deceivers creepe into houſes and leade captive ſilly Women and ignorant Men, to the danger of their own ſoules and the hurt of others. And lamentable it is, that ſuch multitudes of Men and Women ſhould none of them take notice, how they are deluded: for whiles their Paſtors (as they call them) ſeem to give the congregation and the Church ſuch power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as if they could do nothing without their conſent and good liking; yet all this is to make themſelves Lords over them, and as very <hi>Popes</hi> in their Conclaves, who if they be crafty and cunning, make their Conclaves ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their own wills; and doe whatſoever they have a liking to, and a purpoſe to bring to paſſe.</p>
            <p>For what man is there, that hath any diſcerning ſpirit, or is but of any ordinary capacity, that doth not by dayly experience finde, that the Paſtors of their new gathered Churches, do whatſoever pleaſeth them in their ſeverall Congregations; ſo that howſoever to humor the people, they ſay, they can do nothing without the conſent of the whole Aſſembly, it is a meer jugling to my own knowledge; for the poor people count all that their Miniſters ſpeak as an Oracle, and take for truth whatever they ſay; and if they do at any time diſſent from them in their thoughts, they dare not declare it openly, eſpecially the poor members, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring their Miniſters diſpleaſure: for they ordinarily have the chiefeſt hand in the diſtribution of all the collections that are made for the releeving of the indigent, and can at any time either pleaſure or diſpleaſure them: and therefore they endeavour to keep in favour with them, to avoid their frowns, which they know may be very prejudiciall unto them: ſo that their teachers upon all occaſions, do what they themſelves think fit, eſpecially when it makes for their owne advantage and gain, which the moſt of them have alwayes an eye unto (or elſe they are extrame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158558:26"/>abuſed by ſome of their own fraternity.) And if at any time any in their Churches ſeem unwilling to comply with them in their proceedings, yet commonly they have ſuch a party in their Congregations, as they carry all before them; and if for ſome ſhort ſeaſon the greater part oppoſe them, if their paſtors be learned and cunning, what with their Policy, Rhetoricke and fine Art of perſwaſion and ſeeming reaſons, they will ſoon turn the whole Congregation which way they pleaſe: So that howſoever they amuſe the people and tell them of the great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge the Church hath, both in chooſing of Officers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of members, and in tranſacting all things; in fine, all is as they will have it, and all the ignorant people follow their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Paſtors, as a company of ſilly Goſlings do the old Gooſe. And the truth is, they make their Congregation but a company of ninnies (as the falſe Apoſtles uſed to do, as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) and all for their own baſe ends (as will ere long be ſufficiently proved) and exerciſe as great a domination, lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and power, over them, in reſpect of ording things in their ſeverall Churches, as <hi>Popes</hi> in their Conclave, and Kings and Princes in their ſeverall Councells; who if they be wiſe and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke and be Maſters indeed in their Art, and King-craft, as they call it, they will turn their Councells which way they pleaſe; and make uſe of them no farther then ſtands with their own deſigns, and uſe them onely as a ſcreen between them and the people, ever for their own defence and ſafeguard, ſo that if at any time upon extraordinary preſſures and grievances their ſubjects grow into a heat or diſcontent, and begin to murmur; then one or two of the Councellors, muſt for faſhion-ſake be in diſgrace and frown'd on for ſome ſpace, as if they had given bad councell, to ſatisfie the people: when in the mean time, there is nothing but colluſion, the King and they remaining very good friends, as who did nothing nor councelled nothing, but what they knew the King himſelfe would have done, and uſed them onely as his inſtruments for the effecting of it; and all this to delude the people, and to regain their good opinion: for all wiſe Princes ever ſhew themſelves favourably to the people upon any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſeeming to greeve at nothing more that their ſubjects (who they look on as children) ſhould in the leſt thing ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government, and eſpecially by their own ſervants, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158558:26"/>this method of dealing gives great content to ſubjects in all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and that Princes know well. After the very ſame manner do the crafty Independent Paſtors deal with their Churches upon all occaſions; and when they deſire to bring any plot of theirs to paſſe that may be advantageous and profitable unto them, then they put the people upon it; ſo that if any diſgrace be like to come by it, then the congregations muſt have that lye upon them, as who have the chiefe ordering of things in their ſeverall aſſemblies, for they profeſſe themſelves all ſervants of the Church, and to be at their diſpoſing, and to go and come at their appointment, and to do nothing but by their good liking, and <hi>Pope-like,</hi> they ſay they are <hi>Servi Servorum.</hi> And then for the colouring of all their juglings, they tell them of the Church in Jeruſalem and that of Corinth, who had the power of Chooſing their Officers, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of offenders, and doing whatſoever they pleaſed within themſelves; and they ſtand, they ſay, as ſingle perſons, and may not in the leaſt infringe or impeach the rights and priviledges of the Church; when notwithſtanding nothing is done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own direction, and by their ſpeciall inſtigation, and ſo they ever preſerve their own reputation, and ſeem to be friends to ſuch as they mortally hate, and lay all upon the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> whoſe example they affirm all Churches are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and whoſe pattern they muſt imitate: now that being but one Congregation and Aſſembly (for ſo they perſwade the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people) ever having had plenary power within it ſelf, as all the other Churches; the ſeverall congregations through the world (as they aſſert) have within themſelves the ſame power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of ordering and tranſacting all things that concerne the Church, as the Church of Jeruſalem, and thoſe other ſeverall Churches had, and from the which there is no appeal; and all this is but miſerably to abuſe the people, and cunningly to make themſelves Lords over them, whiles they ſeem highly to honour the profeſſing to be their ſervants: &amp; for my part I ſhal ever pray, that all the Independent Miniſters through the world may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſervants of the Churches and States wherein they live, and never become their Maſters; for all men may ſee by the very beginning of their domination, how they would Lord it over all congregations, if they were once eſtabliſhed by authority, when they ſpeak ſo big in their childhood and infancy, and doe thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:158558:27"/>daring actions againſt the great Councell of the Kingdome they dayly exerciſe: abuſing all authority that is not of their own mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, in word and deed, in writing and preaching, to the very ſcandall of Religion: all which they could not be ſuffered to do, if there were once a learned Presby try ſet up as they well know and ſuch a Church government as was in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and in all thoſe Primative Churches, the which were ſo many ſeverall corporations, every one of them conſiſting of ſeverall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and all governed by the joynt conſent and common councell of their ſeverall Colledges of Presbyters, to the which every particular member, and every ſeverall Congregation and Aſſembly in their particular Precincts and Juriſdictions, had their appeals upon all occaſions, and that by divine inſtitution, and ſtood to the arbitration of every ſeverall Presby try, or elſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon non ſatisfaction or conceived wrong, to their ſeverall and more generall Claſſes, higher Presbyters or Synods, as we ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 6. &amp; 15. where we have both precept and preſidents of ſo ordering and ruling the Church to the end of the world; for Chriſt who is the Law-giver of his Church hath ſo appointed it: and whatſoever the Apoſtles did in the ordinary way of governing the Church, they did it for example to future ages as they in their writing declare and invite all Miniſters and people to their imitation. And if Chriſtians under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament had not ſeverall places to appeal to, and higher Courts of judicature then their particular Congregations and Churches, they ſhould be inferiour to the Synagogues of the Jews, and to that Nation in many reſpects: for it is well known to thoſe that have ever read the holy Scripture, that they had ſeverall Courts to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to, upon conceived wrong and in all difficult buſineſſes, and this was no ceremoniall way of Government, but a morall and permanent way of ordering things to the end of the world: and our bleſſed Saviour conſtituted the ſame manner of Government Eccleſiaſticall (the Leviticall Prieſt-hood and that Order being aboliſhed with all their Ceremonious ſervices) that was in all the Cities of <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Iſarel,</hi> and through all their Synagogues who were all Ariſtocratically and Presbyterianly governed, who were moderated and Ordered by ſeverall Colledges of Judges in their ſeverall Precincts cal'd Rulers, of which there were ſome inferiour and ſome chiefe Rulers or Judges, as it is in all Courts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158558:27"/>of judicature through the world: and this manner of government is that that was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles, and was continued in the Primitive Churches, till <hi>Antichriſt</hi> that Man of Sinne began to put up his hornes; and who advancing himſelfe above all that is called God, not only puſht down that Presbyterian government and manner of ruling, and trampled it under his poluted feet; but moſt tyrannically inſlaved all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations, and brought them under his unſupportable yoke. And now through the goodneſſe of God, his power is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and aboliſhed, the Independent Miniſters with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would uſurpe the ſame over every congregation; which ought to be managed by the joynt conſent and common-counſell of every Presbytery, to which every Member in every Church, and every particular congregation under their ſeverall Presbyteries, ought to make their addreſſes, and to which they ought to have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon all occaſions. And if the Gentlemen the Independent Miniſters, had that knowledge in Divinity, Hiſtory, or very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, that they would perſwade the world they were ſo great Maſters in, they would never have ſpake, preached, and writ that they have done againſt common reaſon, all antiquity, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Word of God it ſelf in defence of their fond opinion. For what man of ordinary judgement ever read, what the word or a name of a <hi>City</hi> meant, and what is underſtood by it, was ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, as to conceive where <hi>Paul</hi> appointed <hi>Titus,</hi> cap. 1. <hi>That he ſhould ordaine Presbyters in every City,</hi> that the Apoſtle there meant by <hi>City,</hi> one congregation or particular aſſembly in every City; when if we take notice of that word, we ſhall finde in all Hiſtories both Divine and Humane, that by <hi>City</hi> is meant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the compaſſe of ground and houſes and ſtreets incloſed within the wals of any place, and the inhabitants dwelling in it: but by <hi>City</hi> the whole country is to be underſtood and comprehended, whoſe inhabitants are governed by the ſame law that thoſe within the City are. And this manner of ſpeaking is ſo frequent in all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories both ſacred and prophane, as nothing is more common, as all learned men know, and therefore I cite not authorities to prove it, with which I might fill a Volume. So that when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commanded <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine Presbyters and Biſhops in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City, he then eſtabliſhed a Presbytery or Colledge of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that might with wiſdome and in knowledge governe all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158558:28"/>thoſe ſeverall congregations and particular aſſemblies of Believers that then were in theſe ſeverall Cities, and as many as in future time ſhould be converted to the faith by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell within theſe Cities, and Villages about the City, as far as the juriſdiction and limits of the ſecular government did ſtretch and extend it ſelf: for the Secular government and the Eccleſiaſticall went alwayes together, as it doth at this day through the world in all well ordered Principalities and Common-weals: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as the Teritories of every City in thoſe dayes extended it ſelfe, ſo far did the Presbyters authority ſpread and extend it ſelf: and therefore when the Apoſtle enjoyned <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>ordaine Preſbyters in every City,</hi> he eſtabliſhed there a Councell, Senate, Court, or Colledge of Presbyters, and an Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to the which he gave power to exerciſe their authority over all the particular congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies that were then already converted, and that ſhould be converted afterward, both within the wals of the City, and within the circumference and bounds of the whole juriſdiction to the end of the world; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that that Presbytery and Colledge by joynt conſent and common counſell ſhould governe all thoſe ſeverall congregations. And this is Gods Ordinance. And as all the Cities in Judea and Iſrael under their ſeverall Kings were notwithſtanding governed by a ſecular Presbytery, as all Corporations are here in England, ſo they were alſo by an Eccleſiaſticlal, and had their Rulers of their Synagogues and appeals from inferiour Courts to ſuperiour upon all juſt occaſions, and that by Gods appointment, and by Chriſts own ratification, as the Scripture doth frequently ſpecifie in many places. And indeed if any man of mature judgement, and with deliberation would but conſider what all Hiſtories relate concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the originall of Cities, and the cauſe of their building, and how farre their Territories and their Lines (if I may ſo ſay) of communication extended, with their inhabitants which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes counted Citizens, they could never be induced to believe that grolliſh opinion of Independency. For when the Lord divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole Earth to the ſeverall families of the ſame, he alwaies reſerved a portion for his own children, for he is the preſerver of all, eſpecially of the Believers, as it is related <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Now as the Families of the Earth multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and increaſed, they extended their habitations further and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158558:28"/>further, from countrey to countrey, till they had repleniſhed all places according to Gods command and bleſſing, <hi>Increaſe and multiply:</hi> and as they ſeated themſelves in any new Plantation, for their ſafety and more ſecure habitation, and to free themſelves from incurſions of any enemies, they built themſelves Cities and great walled Townes (having learned that leſſon of <hi>Cain,</hi> the fruits of ſin, that made man both naked and afraid of every thing) and that they might be furniſhed with all proviſions and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they allotted unto every City ſuch a circuit and compaſſe of ground as out of the which they might have all their neceſſaries ſupplied, and be accommodated with all things needfull for food and raiment and their bodily preſervation, which required a large extent of ground, and of which they might take at pleaſure, there being enough, and for this very end they ſtocked the grounds about their ſeverall Cities with cattell, and ſent out as their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies increaſed, their Colonies and Semenaries, as Bees uſe yearly to do their Swarmes; and thoſe they ſeated in the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and fertileſt places, and fitteſt for habitation through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who manured and tilled the ground, and planted Vineyards, and built Villages and Towns; all the which ſtill were accounted Citizens: &amp; as Merchants here in <hi>London</hi> that are Citizens &amp; that have houſes and habitations in the countrey, loſe not their former denomination by their countrey habitation; no more did the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe dayes, but were alwayes with all the inhabitants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of that countrey, reputed Citizens, and call'd by the name of ſuch a City, becauſe they were governed by the ſame lawes the City was, and were derived from it, and were under the command of the chiefe of thoſe families, who all lived as Kings at firſt. And therefore into whoſe hands ſoever thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fell, either by ſucceſſion, donation, compact, mariage or victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thoſe that were the owners or conquerours of them, ſtill for the moſt part continued and preſerved the diviſions formerly made, and kept all thoſe Villages and Townes as far as the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of thoſe Cities extended under their command, and all by the name of ſuch Cities as at firſt, and all the dwellers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants within that circumference or circuit were ſtill accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as part of the City as all Hiſtories do relate both ſacred and humane. So that they that were Maſters of thoſe ſeverall Cities, were alſo Lords of all thoſe Villages, which were under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:158558:29"/>diction of thoſe Cities, and as far as the ſecular power of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cities did extend, ſo far did their Eccleſiaſticall. And as thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall cities we read of in the holy Scripture under the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had all their ſeverall civill Presbyters and Elders, or a Councell and Senate of Presbyters in them to govern them under their ſeverall Kings; ſo they had their Eccleſiaſticall or Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Presbyters, or a Colledge of Elders alſo, whoſe authority extended over all their ſeverall congregations, Synagogues, or aſſemblies, as well within the Cities as without, through all the Villages and Townes that were within the compaſſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their ſeverall juriſdictions, as all imperiall Cities through the chriſtian world were in the Primitive times gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are at this day in many places. And therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive any other of the ſeverall Presbyters placed in every City by Apoſtolicall inſtitution, as of thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> but as of ſo many corporations: for we reade that both in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> they had both many Presbyters and many congregations under every ſeverall Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and as men in thoſe ſeverall Cities, Pariſhes, Townes, and Villages were daily converted to the faith, ſo thoſe ſeverall Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Presbyters ordained them more Presbyters by common conſent, and took them continually under their government; which congregations, though many, as far as their juriſdiction extended, were all joyned together under one Presbyterie, and made ſtill in every ſeverall Precinct but one church, as that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and were all governed and ordered by the joynt conſent and common-counſell of their ſeverall Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Presbyters; the miſtaking of the which kinde of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the miſ-underſtanding of the Scriptures, was the cauſe of all the confuſions in the Chriſtian world, and of thoſe ſad dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences here in <hi>England</hi> at this day, and the only occaſion of that vaine opinion of Independency, for ſo I may call it for divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For the tenent of the Independents is this, That in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and in that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and in all the other Churches ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, there were no more Believers in each of them, then could all meet in one place, and in one congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip, and that they were abſolute within themſelves, and from the which there was no appeals: which I affirme is a vaine and fond opinion, contrary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158558:29"/>to both Scripture and reaſon, and all antiquity; and that it is both againſt Scripture and reaſon, I have ſufficiently as I conceive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it in the foregoing diſcourſe. But for a further confirmation of it I ſhall here adde ſome other arguments, that may if it be poſſible undeceive thoſe that have by the falacies and craft of their Teachers been miſled and ſeduced. I muſt confeſſe, it has been a wonder often to me, to ſee that ſuch multitudes of godly people, and thoſe that I had thought had been ſo well grounded in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhould be ſo carried about with every winde of new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, under pretence of New-lights, when they have ſo often been forewarn'd to take heed of deceivers, by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and that in ſuch a violent manner, and with ſuch exaſpirated ſpirits againſt their Brethren, that cannot aſſent unto thoſe novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For if they had ever read the holy Scriptures with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or been but a little acquainted with the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtories, they could never have been ſo ſuddenly deluded. For if we but reade the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles with attention, or the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the writings of the New Teſtament; we ſhall finde in them all, that by the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel and by the wonderfull working of miracles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whole cities and countries were converted unto the faith; and that the Goſpel was generally imbraced, and whole Nations converted and brought to the obedience of the faith by it, in a very ſhort time: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 1 ver. 8. ſaith, that their faith <hi>was spoken of through the whole world:</hi> and in chap. 10. verſ. 18. he ſaith, <hi>That the ſound of the Goſpell went into all the earth, and their words</hi> (meaning of the Apoſtles) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world.</hi> And in the 15. chapter and verſ. 18, 19. he affirmeth, <hi>That Chriſt ſo wrought by him, as he made the Gentiles obedient by word &amp; deed, through mighty ſignes &amp; wonders by the prower of the Spirit of God, ſo that from Jeruſalem and round about all Illericum, he had fully Preached the Goſpell, and that he had ſo ſtrived to Preach the Gospel, not where Chriſt was named, leaſt he ſhould build upon another mans foundation.</hi> And in his 1. <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> verſ. 8. He teacheth <hi>That from them the Word of the Lord ſounded, not onely in Macedonia and Achaia, but alſo in every place, ſaith he, your faith to God-ward is ſpread abroad, ſo that we need not to ſpeak any thing.</hi> Here we ſee whol Cities and Countries were converted and became Chriſtians.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158558:30"/>And in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles there is frequent mention of whole Cities and Countries converted by the miracles and Preaching of the Apoſtles: who the people thought of and looked upon, as gods come down from heaven; ſo that all <hi>Aſia</hi> in a ſhort time was converted by the Apoſtles Miniſtery, for the people ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles raiſe the dead and cure all diſeaſes, and that by their very ſhaddows, and by touching but the garments and handcarchiefs, or any thing that came from the ſick; and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they were by and by reſtored unto their former health, and beholding their godly life and holy converſation, and hearing them preach nothing but thoſe things that tended to make them eternally happy: they came in, in mighty multitudes, through Cities and whole Countries, to beleeve the Goſpell, and were made Chriſtians dayly; ſo that by ſome one of their miracles they converted more then could meet well in any one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to partake in all acts of worſhip and to edification; and there was ſtill dayly increaſe upon increaſe of Chriſtians through both Cities and Countries, as both the Scriptures and all the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall hiſtories relate: ſo that all reaſon dictates unto any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible man, that in a ſhort time there muſt of neceſſity in every City, and through the ſeverall Countries be many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Aſſemblies, and many Presbytors, ordained over them for the ruling and governing and dayly inſtructing of them and for the building of them all up in the holy faith: for all theſe the Scripture ſpeakes of, were ſuch as were really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or at leaſt made profeſſion of the ſaith as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and were therefore admitted into the boſome of the Church, and into the fellowſhip of the Saints. And all good reaſon will teach men, that the Apoſtles and thoſe Primative Miniſters, had a more excellent faculty of converting men, then our Independent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors &amp; teachers, by whoſe Miniſtry yet, I never heard of any that were converted; for their Congregations al of them conſiſt of ſuch as were converted to their hands: but if a few of them without miracles, have been ſo powerfull through City and Country to gather ſo many congregations and ſeverall Churches here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and through all the Cities and Towns where they have been preaching their Novelties, ſhall we be ſo blockiſh and ſtupid to think that all the Apoſtles together, and ſo many other famous Miniſters as were for many years, alwayes reſident in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:158558:30"/>they could all convert no more Chriſtians then could meet in one place or congregation? and that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and in the other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countries where the Scripture relateth that there was ſuch infinite multitudes dayly converted, and additions of new beleevers upon new beleevers added to the Church, that they might ever meet in one Congregation and in one Aſſembly to communicate in all the Ordinances? no reaſon will perſwade this to any man, that hath not promiſed to himſelf to beleeve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he ſeeth with his own eyes. But that I may again return to the Church in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the pattern of all Churches for government; I affirm that in that great and mighty city, there were more beleevers than could meet in any one or a few places, to communicate in all acts of worſhip, and that there were many Congregations of Chriſtians there in the Apoſtles times, and many years after. And beſides the many reaſons I have in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Treatiſe ſpecified, for a further demonſtration of the truth of that Aſſertion, I ſhall here adde a few more. And amongſt other that out of <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> which I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched in the foregoing Tractate; where he ſignifieth to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that he received not the Goſpell from the Apoſtles, but from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, that they might the more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imbrace it, and give credit unto it: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I preached the Goſpell in Arabia, to the heathens before I ſaw the Apoſtles, and had continued my Miniſtery three years before I went up to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to them.</hi> Indeed after <hi>three years, ſaith he, I went up to Ieruſalem, to ſee Peter, and aboade with him fifteen dayes, but other of the Apostles ſaw I none ſave Iames the Lords brother,</hi> (not that they were abſent) <hi>and therefore I received not the Goſpell from them, but from Chriſt himſelf.</hi> In the which words we have not onely a ſingular Argument to confirm the Preaching and writing of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be the Word of God againſt the Papiſts, but we have alſo an excellent reaſon againſt the new opinion of the Independents, to prove many congregations in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> was a diligent frequenter of the Synagogues and Aſſemblies of the Jews and Chriſtians where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came (as it is often ſpecified in the Scripture) where he Preached the Word and Goſpell unto the people: and it is alſo cleer and evident by the ſame Scripture, as in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and in the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and many other places,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158558:31"/>that Synagogue and Church were Sunonymaes, and are often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one for another, as Biſhops and Presbyter are for the ordinary Miniſters and Preachers of the Word. Now by the very light of reaſon, all men that have not reſined their underſtanding, will gather, That if there had been but one meeting place or one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Believers in the Church of Jeruſalem, that <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there fifteen dayes, in all that times he would have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Aſſembly of Believers, at leſt if he had not preached unto them, who was ſo diligent both in hearing and in preaching in al other places were he came: and if there had then been but one meeting-place in Jeruſalem, and but one congregation, without doubt the Apoſtles would daily have been at their imployments, which were, to pray with the people, and preach unto them, for they never were idle nor deſerted not their charge. Now when they were alwayes imployed in their ſeverall miniſteries, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that there were ſeverall aſſemblies or congregations of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Jeruſalem, that hindred the Apoſtles from viſiting one another; for if there had been but one congregation, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles ſhould have met there in ſo long a ſpace: and therefore it ſtands with all reaſon that there were many congregations of Believers in Jeruſalem, if we had no teſtimonies of holy Scripture for to prove it.</p>
            <p>For if any credit may be given to the Hiſtorians that write of theſe times, there were above three of four hundred Synagogues in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem (I ſpeak within compaſſe) and common underſtanding dictates that there were ſome hundreds of aſſembling places, where there was ſo many hundred thouſand people, and ſuch multitudes of Teachers. And in thoſe Synagogues the people met together, to hear the Law and Prophets both read and interpreted unto them: and the Synagogues both in Jeruſalem, and through all Judea and Paleſtine, were the places of the morall worſhip, as the Temple was the principall place of the cerimoniall ſervice. And as here in London, <hi>Pauls</hi> was the place, where after the Jewiſh, or rather Heatheniſh faſhion and manner, they had their ceremoniall imployments, which conſiſted in outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, as crouchings and cringings, capings and kneeings, pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tooting, in Popes, Surplices, and their four ſquare Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turds and crotchets, windings and turnings, Altars, Croſſes and Crucifixes, and a thouſand other ſuch trumperies; the acting of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:158558:31"/>all which made the judicious Chriſtian-beholders think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rather in the ſchool of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> or in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the old Roman Prieſts then converſant in the Church of God: ſo the other Churches through the City, were the places where the Morrall worſhip was chiefely exerciſed; as the reading, preaching, and hearing of the Word, chatechiſing, exhortation, admonition, prayers, thankſgiving, &amp;c. So after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was in Jeruſalem. The Temple was the principle place of the Ceremoniall Worſhip, and the Synagogues were the places of the Morrall Service; where <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were read and interpreted unto them, every Sabbath day. And it followeth of neceſſity, that there muſt needs be a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Synagogues in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where there were many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand people, and ſuch multitudes of Rabbies and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and ſuch a number of Prieſts, Levites, Scribes, Phariſees, and Lawyers, all Interpreters of the Law, and ſuch as ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair, who our Saviour commanded the people to hear.</p>
            <p>Now, as in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> after their Latine Service, and their Idolatrous Maſſes were caſt out of all the Churches; and the reformed Religion was ſet up in the ſeverall Congregation in place of that falſ Worſhip, and all the people repaired ſtill, and more willingly and more abundantly unto their ſeverall Pariſh Churches, and Chappels, to hear the Word Preached; and as the meetings and meeting-places were ſtill continued, whereas they onely heard Maſſes before, which they underſtood not, now they heard the Goſpell purely preached unto them in lieu of that; and the people came more abundantly unto thoſe aſſemblies. Even ſo whereas before the comming of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and of our bleſſed Saviour, they had the Law, Pſalms, and Prophets, read and Interpreted unto them in all their Synagogues, after the Goſpell began to be publiſhed; to the Law and the Prophets, the glad tidings of Peace was Preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the other Primative Chriſtian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and by many of the Prieſts that imbraced the faith; and that in all their Synagogues every Sabboth day, eſpecially where the people upon all occaſions in great multitudes met together: for it is ſaid, <hi>That the Kingdome of heaven ſuffered violence, and the violent tooke it by force.</hi> Now to any man that will not reſolve to ſhut his eyes, and refuſe to ſee the Sun-ſhine of the truth, it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:158558:32"/>may appear that all the Synagogues in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in all other Cities, after the Chriſtian Religion was ſo generally imbraced, and the Jews were turned Chriſtians; were the places where they ſtill continued to meet in, to hear the Goſpell as formerly they had done to hear the Law, and there is many teſtimonies out of holy Scripture, to prove this Aſſertion: neither can we in charity think that they being made Chriſtians, were leſſe zealous to hear the Goſpell, then they were to hear the Law; yea, their diligence in that good work, is often mentioned in the holy Scripture to their praiſe and honour; as that they met dayly in the Temple and in every houſe, to hear the Word and to partake in all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And it is well known, that <hi>Paul</hi> into what City ſoever he came, was as diligent in preaching as the people in hearing. Now when he remained in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fifteen dayes, he would not be idle: and it is to be beleeved that the other Apoſtles were as diligent in their ſeverall Miniſtries as <hi>Paul</hi> was, as I ſaid before; ſo that their much imployment without doubt, was the onely cauſe that hindred the Apoſtles from comming unto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded <hi>Paul</hi> from ſaluting of them: for we may not conceive, that ſo famous an Apoſtle as <hi>Paul</hi> was, could lye hid in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> or be unknown ſo long from the other Apoſtles; neither in charity may we think, that there was any love wanting either in <hi>Paul</hi> towards them, or in the Apoſtles towards <hi>Paul;</hi> but we moſt impute their not viſiting of each other, to the multiplicity of their imployments, that ſo hindered them, that they could not finde convenient time, each to ſee other. So that by this I have now ſaid, it is evident to any rationall man, that there were more Chriſtians and beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then either could or did meet together in one place for all Acts of worſhip: for they met every Sabbath day together in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues to hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets read and Interpreted, as the Scripture affirmeth, yea from houſe to houſe dayly: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may eaſily gather, that as many Synagogues and meeting places as there were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſay nothing of the Temple, ſo many Churches and Congregations of beleevers there were in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for Synagogue and Church are all one in Gods dialect, and they that were <hi>Jews</hi> before the preaching of the Goſpell, were now made Chriſtians and beleevers. Neither had the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> any cauſe to ſeparate themſelves from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158558:32"/>the congregations, for there was nothing in their Synagogues to ſcruple them, without the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould offend them, and that the Scripture teſtifies they were very zealous of; and many of them that were converted, perſwaded the Gentiles after their converſion and illumination, to joyn the Ceremoniall Law to the Goſpell, which although it was not permitted unto them, yet for a time it was connived at and tollerated in the weak Jews; yea, in the tenth of the Hebrews the Chriſtians are blamed for forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the aſſembling of themſelves together, and it was counted a fault in them: and therefore it may without any error be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there were as many, if not more Aſſemblies and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues of beleevers in Jeruſalem after the preaching of the Goſpell and in the Apoſtles times, as were before of the Jews: for they after they were Chriſtians continued ſtill to aſſemble themſelves, if not dayly, every Sabbath day at leaſt in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as they were wont to do, where the Apoſtles were all ſo taken up in preaching, as they had no leiſure for reciprocall ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and therefore of neceſſity there were more congregations in the Church of Jeruſalem, and a greater multitude of Chriſtians them could all meet in any one or a few places: even as it was here in <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, as I ſpecified before: there was no fewer congregations and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Proteſtants in <hi>London,</hi> then was before of Papiſts: for as many Pariſh Churches as there were in the city of <hi>London</hi> ſo many ſeverall congregation of Proteſtants there were then through the city; and they that profeſt Popery before, did now imbrace the Proteſtant Religion, and made ſo many congregations and ſeverall Churches of Proteſtants, as there were congregations of Papiſts before: and as it would be accounted great abſurdity, yea a ridiculous thing in any man to affirm that there was but as many Proteſtants in <hi>London,</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> his time, or in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes, as could all meet in one place or in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; ſo to any underſtanding and intelligible man, it is as abſurd to conclude that there were no more chriſtians and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Jeruſalem then could all meet in one place and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Scripture it ſelf affirmeth that all Jeruſalem was turned Chriſtians, and had their meetings and aſſemblies in the Temple, and in every houſe; and that there was many aſſemblies there, and it ſtands with all reaſon, that if there had been but one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:158558:33"/>Congregation of beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit <hi>Peter,</hi> that then he of neceſſity ſhould have ſeen ſome, at leaſt of the other Apoſtles beſides <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames;</hi> for without doubt <hi>Paul</hi> was dayly among the Chriſtians a preaching to them in their Synagogues or meeting places; and the other Apoſtles alſo whoſe duty it was to be continually taken up in praying and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching amongſt them, would not ſo long a time have layen idle and private: but in that neither <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw them, not the Apoſtles <hi>Paul,</hi> it is a ſufficient Argument to prove there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aſſemblies of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them all in their ſeverall Miniſteries as they had no time for mutuall viſits; and that was the onely cauſe that hindred them from ſaluting one another: ſo that I conceive by that which I have now ſaid, all underſtanding men will gather that there were more congregations of beleevers in the Church of Jeruſalem then one; and that all theſe ſeverall aſſemblies made but one Church, and were all governed by the joynt conſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councell of one Presbytery; whatſoever the Independent Miniſters perſwade the poor deluded people to the contrary, for the upholding of their imaginary Presbyterian Government, which is againſt all Scripture, Antiquity, Reaſon, and Ordinary ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore I may boldly aſſert in their dealing with their ſeverall Congregations, when they ſet before them their Churches of <hi>Ieruſalem, Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> as conſiſting of but one Congregation and Aſſembly a peece, they juggle with them for no other end, but to make themſelves Lords and maſters of them, and to get the Soveraignty in time over the people into their own hands, while they would ſeem to be their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>And therefore it highly concerns all men that deſire the peace and welfare of Church and ſtate, duly to weigh and ſeriouſly to conſider the danger of Schiſms and rents in either, which ought to move them to ſtudy by all means how rather they make up the breaches already made, and how now to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together in love and unity, againſt the common enemies of them both; then to follow ſuch blind leaders and guides as by their factions and fractions will bring us all into the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and expoſe us and our poſterities to as great miſery
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158558:33"/>and ſlavery, both for ſouls and bodies, as ever Nation groaned under.</p>
            <p>And as it is the duty of every private Chriſtian in his particular family; to teach and inſtruct his children and ſervants in the nurture and fear of the Lord, and with all ſingular care to purge his houſe of all ſuch as may miſleade them, and ſeduce and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them that are in their tender years, and not well grounded in the principalls of Religion, &amp; to give them ſpeciall charge to haunt no ſuch places and company, as by which they may be viciated in their manners, or poyſoned with falſ and erronious doctrines and opinions, as the Word of God commands both in the Old and New Teſtament. So it is the duty of all Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their ſeverall places, who are the Paſtors of the people, the one for their bodily preſervation and the common peace, and the other for their ſpirituall good to joyn together for the ſetting up of Gods true Worſhip, Government, and Service; in all Cities, Towns, and Pariſhes through the Kingdome; the one by their power and authority, and the other by lifting up their voyce like a Trumpet (as all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles did in all their generations againſt all falſe teachers) and to warn the people under their ſeverall charges, to take heed of them and ſhun them as they either deſire Gods glory, their own eternall Salvation, or the publike preſent good and the proſperity and tranquility of their off-ſpring in ſucceeding ages; and to be as ſedulous and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſuppreſſing errours and ſchiſms, as all the godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and faithfull Miniſters have been in their ſeverall times, whoſe praiſes for this their good work is frequently recorded in holy writ, and in all the Eccleſiaſticall Records to their eternall honour and renoune, and for our inſtruction. And truely if the examples of the holy Prophets, bleſſed Apoſtles, and godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and of all the deer ſervants of God whoſe names and fames are glorious to all poſterity in the holy Word of God; will not move us; then at leaſt let us learn of the very enemies, of the Papiſts, Sectaries, and Hereticks in all precedent and fore-going Generations; for they, as all hiſtories and dayly experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, not onely labour to remove all ſuch out of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Churches, as be of a contrary opinion to them but ſtudy alſo to exterminate them out of their very territories, if they have ſtrength or policy ſo to do.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:158558:34"/>
            <p>And if none of their examples may yet perſwade us to our duty, then let the example of all thoſe that now differ from us in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in the matter of government teach us what to do in this point: for they will not willingly entertain any into their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that is not of their own minde and opinion, nor ſuffer their children to be inſtructed in any other way then their own; and ſhun, in as much as in them lyes, the very company of ſuch as they count Presbyterians; and rarely, if ever, come at our aſſemblies. And in <hi>New-England</hi> it ſelf it is well knowne, that they doe not only caſt thoſe out of their Churches that differ from them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but alſo expoſe them to baniſhment and to greateſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and think all they do, to be their duty; and publiſh it to the world for the imitation of all other their Churches and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and I am moſt aſſured, had they the authority in their own hands here in England, they would be as ſevere towards the Presbyterians, as ever the Prelates were againſt the Puritans. And I am induced ſo to believe, both from their words and writings: for what can be more bitterly uttered againſt them, then that they daily ſpeak upon the leaſt occaſion, if any but preach or write the leaſt thing in oppoſition to their opinions; profeſſing that all ſuch Preachers ought to be hanged: and had they the power in their hands, they would truſſe them up, as many can teſtifie and witneſſe: and in their writings, how prodigiouſly daily they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe with all manner of calumnies and reproaches, and with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling ſpeeches, the Presbyterians, all that have patience to reade their blaſphemous Pamphlets can tell: ſo that whiles in them they pleade for a tolleration of all Religions, they will not tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Presbyterians to defend their own; by which they ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare what favour they would ſhew them if they were in their hands, on whom they look as the profeſt enemies of Chriſts kingdome. Now I ſay, if neither the example of Gods dear Saints and Servants, nor the Word of God can move us to our duty, nor the example of the Papiſts and Hereticks of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: then at leaſt let us follow the example of our Brethren both in <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Old-England;</hi> for they as all men know re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all from them that differ from them in their Church-way; and ſeperate themſelves from us, and gather congregations by by themſelves, Independent, refuſing to communicate with us as an unholy people, and not ſuffering or permitting us to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:158558:34"/>communicate amongſt them in the Ordinances either of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme or the Lords Supper, but upon their own tearmes; and account us all as unclean things, and to be ſeparated from, which I affirme ſhould move all ſolid Chriſtians, and ſuch as truly and unfeinedly deſire that God may be glorified, and his truth every where ſet up, to oppoſe all their errors and novelties in religion, under what pretenſes ſoever they be brought in, and under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeeming holineſſe they be ſet forth: and ſo much the more care is to be had, and diligence uſed, both by the Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and all the reall godly of the land; by how much they know the craft and ſubtilty of thoſe that ſeduce them: for there was never yet any Sect whatſoever, that came to any riſe, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or name in the Church, of which the firſt venters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers had not ſome ſeeming ſhew of godlineſſe and holineſſe of life, and that more then ordinary, to which they uſually added the bravery of language, and fine alluring ſpeeches, and cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe; as they were many of them men of ſingular elocution, and deep ſubtilty: as the Prophets and Apoſtles through the whole Scripture ſignifie. And <hi>Paul</hi> in the 16 chap. of his Epiſtle to the Romans, ſpeaking of thoſe that made diviſions contrary to the doctrine that he had taught them, hath this expreſſion, Verſe 18. <hi>For they that are ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and by good words and faire ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Here we ſee the falſe Teachers of his time, made <hi>uſe of good words, faire speeches, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. the Apoſtle there exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſaith. <hi>Henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every winde of doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lye in wait to deceive.</hi> In this place the Apoſtle gives all Chriſtians a charge to take heed of all erroneous doctrines; and withall ſets down the manners and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary carriage of all ſeducers, that they might be the more carefull to ſhunne them: for ſuch, ſaith he, uſe in the deceiving of you, <hi>the flight of men, and cunning craftineſſe.</hi> This has ever been the method of all falſe teachers, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo in his 2 Epiſtle, chap. 2. verſ. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. witneſſeth: for ſpeaking of the falſe teachers of thoſe times he lived in, and of thoſe in future ages, that <hi>ſhould bring in damnable doctrines, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themſelves ſwift distruction:</hi> he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:158558:35"/>foretels alſo, that <hi>many ſhould follow their pernicious wayes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom the way of truth ſhould be evilly ſpoken of.</hi> And then alſo he ſets down the manner and cuſtomes of thoſe ſeducers; and amongſt other things he ſaith of them, that <hi>through covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and with their faire words they ſhould make merchandize of the people.</hi> So that we may ſee, all falſe teachers clothe their craft with their rhetorick <hi>and fained words,</hi> for otherwiſe they would prevaile but little. Now by how much more the Chriſtians in this our age have to deale with a generation of cunning and crafty Juglers, who ſeeme to equallize, if not to tranſcend all others in holineſſe and godlineſſe, in their outward cariage at leaſt; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth every one I ſay more diligently to take heed of them, and of all their new-wayes, their new born truths, and their New-lights: for God himſelfe by his holy Prophets and bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles has commanded us, not to decline from thoſe wayes we have learned of him, and thoſe truths that he hath taught us in his holy Word, <hi>Neither to the right hand nor to the left, Dut.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. Nay, if an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach otherwiſe then God hath taught us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, we <hi>are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1. And in the expreſſe words above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, we are prohibited to <hi>be carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> So that all thoſe that vent thoſe new-truths and ſet up thoſe new-lights, which are all indeed new-lights of doctrins, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſeemingly holy, are all cunning deceivers &amp; fighters againſt God. And all thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrates (for ought I know) that tollerate ſuch; and all thoſe orthodox Miniſters that connive at them, and are ſo meal-mouthed, as they dare not preach againſt them, and forwarne the people of them, neglect their duty; and are not faithfull Watchmen over their flocks committed to their charge, and are blameworthy for it. And all thoſe people that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo often taught by God himſelf in the holy Scriptures, to take heed of all ſuch as come to them in ſheeps clothing, and with their fained holineſſe, &amp; with their fair ſpeeches to deceive them, and make merchandize of them, and yet will not take heed of theſe novelties; doe as much as in them lyes reſiſt the Spirit of God: for the Lord has againe and againe commanded all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſhun ſuch men, as in <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. chap. 6. verſ. 5. <hi>From ſuch</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all ages to the end of the world) <hi>withdraw thy ſelfe.</hi> Now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158558:35"/>if an Evangeliſt, ſo learned a man, ſo well grounded a preacher as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, to withdraw himſelfo from all ſuch as taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; Chriſt himſelf &amp; the other Apoſtles had taught: how much more now ought all Chriſtians that come ſo far ſhort and are ſo inferiour to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for all indowments and graces of knowledge, to beware and take heed of all ſuch as bring in their new-born truths, their new-Lights, and all their new wayes; when eſpecially we are commanded to enquire for the old and good way, which will indeed <hi>bring reſt unto our ſouls? Jer.</hi> 6. And to omit innumerable places to this purpoſe; that of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Elect Lady, ſhould ever be in our memory, where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in expreſſe words forbids that Lady and her family, and in them all other Chriſtians, <hi>To receive any that bring not the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt into their houſes, or bid them God-ſpeed,</hi> and gives a reaſon of this his prohibition; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he that bids him God-ſpeed, is partaker of his evill deeds.</hi> Now all theſe new doctrines are not the doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore whoſoever bringeth them, ought not to be received into our families, nor their doctrines into our hearts, no more then ſtolen goods into our houſes and cloſets: for God hath both forbid it, and ſet down the danger that will enſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: for by that means we make our ſelves equally guilty, and partakers with them in their evill: and therefore all ſuch as ſhall ſtill notwithſtanding whatſoever God hath ſpake unto us by his holy Prophets and Apoſtles, follow thoſe new teachers and thoſe new truths, by their ſo doing, in concluſion they will be found fighters againſt God; and partake with them in all thoſe puniſhments the Lord hath threatned againſt all ſuch as will be led about with every wind of Doctrine, which will be the ruin of themſelves and others: and if people will be diſobedient and obſtinately go on to make Schiſms and rents, ſlighting Gods threats and menaces, and caſt his word behind their backs, then it belongeth unto all Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Fathers, and Maſters of Families, that are Chriſtians (for I ſpeake not of ſuch as are without the pale of the Church) ſeeing what already theſe new Sects have with all their Art and cunning, invented, contrived, and with unwearied paines and ungodly policy brought forth into the world, that the Magiſtrates are counted intollerable to the people; wives are taken from the boſomes of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158558:36"/>their husbands, or ſo alienated from them as they repute the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a burthen unto them: the Husbands from the Wife, Children from their Parents, and Patents from their children; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, &amp; Friends from Friends; the Miniſters from the people, and the flocks from their Paſtors; and that all the lawes of God and Nature by theſe means are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; I ſay in all theſe regards it is high time, if they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe evils that are comming upon the Land by theſe fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diviſions, now to quit themſelves like men, not caring for all the reviling languages of Seducers who yet never ſpake well of any but of their own party: for it is againſt the nature of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries to give any a good word but their own complices; and therefore it concernes them all to goe about the work as men of courage and in the fear of God. And truly if men think it (as it is indeed) an unſufferable thing to tolerate thoſe Men-ſtealers, who they call Spirits, or a new generation of Fayries, to ſeduce and carry away their children and ſervants: then much more it is an unſufferable thing to tolerate thoſe that ſteale away not only the bodies of men and children, from Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Parents, Maſters and Miſtreſſes, Friends, &amp;c. but their very hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and are no better in ſo doing then a company of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Plunderers, and are to be looked on as ſo many enemies of the Church and kingdome. Neither is there any breach of charity in ſpeaking truth with love and an unfained deſire of their refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: for if they be not reformed, nor their New-lights extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and put out, they will in ſhort time dim and darken the truth it ſelfe, and provoke the Lord to give us all over to error, becauſe we <hi>imbraced not the truth in the love of it,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. But I muſt confeſſe I look upon many of the Independent Miniſters, as the moſt dangerous Sect that ever yet the world produced, in reſpect of the conſequences of their doctrines, and the ſad effects they have brought forth already, whereſoever they have ſpread it. For they carry themſelves more cunningly then any other Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks or Hereticks that ever yet appeared ſince mortality inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the World. For all other Sectaries tenents are recorded in all the ſeverall Councels, and in the Monuments of the ancient Writers, ſo that every man knowes their opinions and doctrines; but what theſe men hold beſides their whimſey of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the manner of their gathering of Churches (wherein
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158558:36"/>they doe not all agree neither) no man knoweth nor never ſhall know, for they intend to ſet up many other New-lights, but yet with a reſerve, never to be conſtant to any thing what they either ſay or write: for this I have received from the mouthes of their Diſciples and followers, That if that which ſeemeth a truth to them to day, do to morrow appear otherwiſe by ſome new light, (were it any Article of the faith) and they be convinced by that light, that they were in an error before, they are to relinquiſh their former tenent, whatſoever it were, and to follow that new light that God hath appeared to them in. And this doctrine is taught by all the Independents I ever ſaw or heard of. Yea they count it a great honour unto them to be thus uncertaine in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; as we may ſee in a rayling and rediculous Pamphlet, not only againſt Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> but againſt the Parliament, lately ſet out by an Independent, call'd, <hi>The falſhood of</hi> M. William Prynnes <hi>Truth Triumphing;</hi> where <hi>pag.</hi> 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. in theſe words, <hi>You accuſe the Independents,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as believing moſt things with a reſerve, according to their preſent light; with a liberty of changing, as new-lights ſhall be diſcovered unto them; but did ever man ſo overſhoot himſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>certainly this is ſo high a character of the Independents compleateſt posture enſuing or growing ſtature in the Schoole of Chriſt, as could be applyed unto them; wherein they glory not a little, and place it as the only ground work and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which they cannot grow in grace, from one degree of faith to another, untill they become perfect men, and perfect Saints, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13. Theſe are his formall words, ſo that the Independents do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this: That there is no growth in grace from one degree of ſaith to another, untill we become perfect men, and perfect Saints, unleſſe they believe moſt things with a reſerve; which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of theirs, whether or no it be not to bring a ſceptiſme into Religion, according as M. <hi>Prynne</hi> doth from them conclude, I refer it to the judgement of thoſe that are more judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines then the Author of that Pamphlet. And this, as men may obſerve, is the profeſt doctrine of all the Independents; and they account it their glory to be ever in uncertainties; which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon, as I conceive, that they could never yet be induced to ſet downe what forme of government they would have, and to what doctrine and diſcipline they would ſubſcribe and ſtand to,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:158558:37"/>with their followers; by which all men may eaſily diſcerne the dangerouſneſſe of theſe men; and well perceive, that they that have to deale with them, will never finde an end: for they will ever be ſtarting of ſome new doctrines. And to ſpeak the verity, all the Shiſmaticks that have troubled the Church in this laſt age of the World, and hindred all reformation, are yet more can did then many of the Independent Miniſters through the Kingdome. For the Browniſts, as M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and M. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and more orthodox in their Tenents then many of them, yet they with all their ſeveral congregations agreed in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and have ingenuouſly in their Apologies and writings with modeſty (for <hi>in hoste virtus laudanda</hi>) declared unto the World, both what they held, and what they deſired, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would reſt contented; if the Magiſtrates would but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them in it. The Anabaptiſts in like manner, though farre more erronious in their opinions then the Browniſts, yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, many times in word and print, have ſet downe their Tenents, to which they both ſtand; and in the which, if the Magiſtrates will but condeſcend unto them, they will ſit downe and yeild all cheerfull obedience to their juſt commands. The ſame may be ſaid of all other Sects. But, as for our Brethren the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Miniſters, they are like a company of Rats among Joyne-ſtooles, every one can ſee and heare them, but none can catch them. No man can tell where to catch or lay hold certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any point or tenent they preach, or what they either are in their opinion, or will be: for what they conceived to be a truth to day, may be an error with them to morrow: for certainty in any opinion, is as great a Hereſie to them, as eating of fleſh on a Good-Friday, is to a Papiſt: Neither will they binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their followers to any Doctrine they hold to day; for it may be they will both preach and practiſe the contrary to morrow, if it make for their gaine and emolument. So that all men may boldly conclude of them, that they are as the moſt uncertaine; ſo in that, the moſt dangerous Sect that ever came into the World, ſince the Sunne and Moone ruled over the Earth. And this will the better appeare, if we conſider the multitudes and variety of Sectaries that have ſprung from them in a ſhort ſpace, ſince their comming over amongſt us, with their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealings, how ever they themſelves play leaſt in ſight, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:158558:37"/>act privately their juglings, and make uſe of others, in venting their ſeverall poyſenous opinions, and can ſay and on-ſay, and affirme and deny any thing at pleaſure, as can be proved. Before their apparition on our horiſon, there were but three or four Sects known among us, and they were few in number, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, and ſuch as were full of charity and love one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and carried themſelves humbly towards all men; as the Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, and Familiſts. But out of the Independents lungs are ſprung above forty ſeverall ſorts of ſtraglers, which before their comming over were never heard of amongſt us. And for proof of what I now ſay, I had it from a Brother of mine in tribulation, and a fellow-ſufferer; who though he differ from me in opinion, yet I truly love him, and ſhall never decline any chriſtian office to do him good for ſoule and body; I meane M. <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel; who himſelf rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it unto me, and that in the preſence of others; that returning from the warres to <hi>London,</hi> he met forty new Sects, and many of them dangerous ones; and ſome ſo pernicious, that howſoever, as he ſaid, he was in his judgement for tolleration of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet he profeſt, he could ſcarce keepe his hands off them, and had no patience to heare them, ſo blaſphemous they were in their opinions. So that he gathered, that theſe were now the laſt dayes, wherein ſo many Hereſies abounded. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other of the Tenants, one of thoſe wicked Sects held, They denied the Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accounted them things of nought; whereas by Gods command, They that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, by the mouth of two or three witneſſes were to be put to death: and theſe wicked and ungodly creatures deſpiſe both the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and that in the preſence of a Cloud of witneſſes. And innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other diabolicall Sects there are, and ſo prodigiouſly impious, that it is not for a Chriſtian to name their opinions. And moſt of them, if not all, were firſt Independents, and ſuch as ſeparated from our Congregations, as from a people unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were of their new gather'd Churches and followers of their Miniſtery. And many of them have jangled ſo long about the Church, that at laſt they quite have loſt it, and goe now under the name of <hi>Expectants and Seekers, and doe deny
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:158558:38"/>that there is any true Church,</hi> or any true Miniſters, or any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: and ſome of them affirme, that the Church is yet in the Wilderneſſe, and they are ſeeking for it there: others ſay, that the ſmoke is yet in the Temple, and they are groping for it there, where I leave them: praying God to open their eyes and give them repentance; that they may conſider from whence they are fallen, and returne againe into the boſome of that Church, from which they have, to the great diſhonour of God, and the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of the Goſpel, made ſo fearfull a deſection. But I can truly ſay, without wronging the Independent Miniſters, that they have been one of the principall cauſes of all thoſe new, hidious, and monſtrous opinions, and of all the ſad differences amongſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: for their doctrines give way to all ſuch errors, and ever will, as long as they give liberty for the finding out of new truths, and the changing of their opinions according to their New-lights. But amongſt all their errors this is none of the leaſt, that all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is by them deſpiſed, and made nothing of, no further then it agreeth with their tenents and humours. And howſoever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly they ſeem to ſay ſomething in defence of it, yet privately, and upon all occaſions they ſlight it; yea, and bid defiance to it, as all their rayling Pamphlets, and words, &amp; deeds proclaim; and make the power and authority of the Magiſtrates when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it for the ſuppreſſing of novelties, a meer tyranny and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, as many could witneſſe, if they would take the office of Informers upon them; for they are not the men they were in the beginning of the Parliament: for then they ſeemed highly to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the authority and power of the Parliament, and appealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and did very good ſervice in promoting the publick good: but now they ſay they are afraid it will prove but an Arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be more tyrannicall then that of the Prelates, and all the other unjuſt Courts; profeſſing that they had thought they ſhould by their meanes have enjoyed the liberty of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences (this it ſeems they fought for, their own ends, which they ſo much condemne in others) but now they well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they go about to eſtabliſh a Presbytery, which to the poor Saints (they are afraid) will prove more tyrannicall then the government of the Biſhops: and therefore now many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents that were very zealous at the firſt in the quarrell of the Parliament (as it was their duty to be) are very cold, and have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:158558:38"/>not only caſt away their armes, and detract their obedience, but can at pleaſure ſpeak againſt the preſſing of men for that ſervice; and profeſſe, that is not lawfull to force men to fight, and that it is unlawfull to fight for Religion (I conceive they mean any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but their own: for they have been heard ſay; yea they have frequently bragg'd of their party, and proteſted that they would make hot work before the Presbyterians ſhould have the day) and ſuch like ſtuffe they vent in every corner, to the deterring of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from their duty, which they are bound unto by the Law of God, Nature, and all Nations; and for which there be many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents in holy Scripture, and many fearfull threats and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced againſt ſuch as deſerted their Brethren in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and great and fearfull puniſhments have been impoſed upon thoſe that came not out to aide their Brethren when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of their countrey, whether they were forein or inteſtine: and all to teach us not to decline from our duty upon the like occaſions. But that any man that hath but any ordinary underſtanding ſhould ſpeak againſt the preſſing of men, it is a wonder to me to hear it: for if they ever had read the Scriptures with judgement and knowledge, or were but acquainted with the Hiſtories of all Ages, they may finde it ever hath been the practice of the people of God, as well as of the Heathen, to force men out of all their Tribes and Families to go to war againſt any enemy; and that they that neglected their duty being ſummoned to it, were counted enemies, and were ſeverely puniſht for it, and made examples to others for their diſobedience; and there were none exempted from the war by Gods own appointment, that had ſtrength and abilities to fight, but new married people and baſe Cowards: and indeed to all ſuch, God gave a diſpenſation for a time, as till the one for a year had rejoyced with his Wife, and till the other had got the ſpirit of courage, and a more brave and valiant reſolution: but all others if they would not voluntarily come out, were forced to it or puniſhed for their neglect: and for ought I know, all Chriſtian Magiſtrates have the ſame authority ſtill under the Goſpell that they had under the Law. And truly to my poor underſtanding, there is none that can go more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to fight for their countrey, then they that are preſt; &amp; if I were to go upon any ſuch imployment, I ſhould with ten times more alacrity goe into the war, being preſt or call'd to it by the State,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:158558:39"/>then if I were a meer Volunteere: though I have ever though, Volunteeres brave and gallant men, and worthy of great honour for their good ſervice, and have counted ſuch as would neither by force nor freely, put themſelves upon publike imployment on the one ſide or on the other; eſpecially if they had able bodies, the moſt baſeſt cowardly fellows in the world, and men unworthy the Protection of either King or Parliament; or to enjoy the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry benefit of the ayre they breath in. And without doubt they are the verieſt cowards upon the earth, howſoever they may vapour in a drinking-ſchool. Yet I ſay thoſe that go out as preſt men, have in all reſpects a more warrentable calling, and wherein if they keep themſelves from the ſins and pollutions that are too frequent in Armies, they may both fight and dye with all cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: for in ſo doing they are in their calling, and may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge pitty and compaſſion from all; and maintenance alſo and ſupport if they be wounded, and by it made unable to get their livings for themſelves and for their families, as long as they live; for they have been the ſervants of the State, and imployed by their ſpeciall command; and if they be taken priſoners, the ſtate ought to exchange or ranſome them, or elſe it will be their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Whereas, if they be meerly Volunteers, though they do their duty in ſo doing, and ſhall have the honour of it, if they be hurt, wounded, or captivated; yet the world is wont to ſay, Who required theſe things at your hands, what call had you to this imployment? And all men generally will condemn ſuch: and it was not long ſince objected to a gentlewoman, whoſe hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was taken priſoner in the war, and that in a very Lordly and imperious manner, by an Independent Miniſter; What call, ſaid he, had your husband to take Armes? could not he have followed his own imployment? Thus did this domineering Independent vapour over men in diſtreſſe; who himſelf was never guilty of either learning or humanity, or fit for any thing but to make a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being a meer cow-baby coward, and one that ran away, as being more afraid of the biſhops (when they were in power) then he was of God or the devill; and yet this mounſier could ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliouſly demand of this Gentlewoman, what call her husband had to take Armes? And as this Independent, ſo commonly all men for the moſt part, ſlight Volunteers in their diſtreſſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they deſire their ayde; which they do not only ordinarily
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:158558:39"/>refuſe, but deterre others from doing them any good, ſaying, that ſuch men put themſelves out of Gods protection, in as much as in them is, when they leave their callings; and thus thoſe grolls babble, as if a man had not a ſufficient call, if he ſees his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe on fire, to leave his ſhop to go out to help quench it I Such kinds of Puffoyſts as theſe, that abuſe Volunteers, I leave them as a generation of men, not worthy to give guts unto a Bear. But, I ſay, when men are called to the warre by the State, and preſt to that ſervice, they can then appear with joy before all men, and look death it ſelf in the face with courage; whether in the field, or in cold blood, in the hands of their enemies, when they ſuffer as evill doers: for they can then comfort themſelves with their calling, knowing that they were imployed by the State, and it is their duty to obey; and that as they were borne under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with cheerfulneſſe and alacrity they can dye. And therefore all ſuch as the Independents, that go about to diſparage the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the great Councell of the Kingdome, for preſſing of men for the publick ſervice, do things derogatory to their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and all ſuch as are preſt and able to fight, and do either run away from their Colours, or wilfully or rebelliouſly detract their obedience, ought to be hanged. And as it is lawfull in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to preſſe men to fight for their countrey, ſo it is law full like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for them to fight for their religion; and to preſſe men for that purpoſe: and he that will not fight for his religion, if he be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, certainly he has little religion in him: and he that is a private man, that will not ſuffer for his religion, if he be called to it; nor fight for it both voluntarily and when by authority he is put upon it, but flye from either of the imployments of doing or ſuffering, and will not come out to helpe the Lord againſt the mighty, he deſerveth not only the bitter curſe againſt <hi>Meroſh, Judg.</hi> 5. but to be hanged. What, doe the Brethren the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents now hold it a thing unlawfull to fight for religion (for ſo they profeſſe to their friends) when not long ſince they ſo anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others to it? It ſeems they are very changeable in all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinions: I believe they have found out ſome new-light of direction how to runne away againe, as they did before, if the times change. But yet ſuch as have learned how to performe their duty, and have read the holy Scriptures; and amongſt many other places the two and twentieth of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> for one,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:158558:40"/>have been taught, that when the Iſraelites on the other ſide of Jordan had ſet up an Altar, though it was not with a minde and intent to alter religion, yet if they had not given a ſatisfactory anſwer for their ſo doing to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Elders of Iſrael their Brethren, they would ſpeedily have made warre upon them for it; as any State for ought I know, or any chriſtian Nation by their example may doe, againſt what enemy ſoever they be, whether forein or domeſticall; that ſhall attempt to alter the true religion, and Chriſts government eſtabliſhed in his Church (which is his kingdome) and bring in an Idolatricall one, or an Independent one, or any other that tendeth to the deſtruction of that, that God himſelf hath appointed his people to ſerve him with: and all ſuch as ſhall refuſe to fight for their religion (if they have no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily hindrances or ſome juſt impediment) when the magiſtrate calleth or preſſeth them to it, ought to be accounted as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of religion, and rebels againſt both God and their countrey. And all ſuch as ſhall endeavour, either clandeſtinly or openly, to ſpeak words tending to deterre men from going out to helpe the Lord againſt the Mighty; or refuſe, being Chriſtians, to fight for the Goſpel (except by their bodily infirmities they be hindred from the duty) I know no reaſon but they ought to be hanged as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rebels againſt both God and men, and as ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of Chriſtians, that will not fight for the honour of the King of Saints and King of Kings, and for his royalty and dignity that has redeemed them from the ſlavery, not only of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but of Antichriſt. For we have read that <hi>Michael</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and Commander of his Church and kingdome, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, makes warre againſt the Dragon and his Angels; which is not to be underſtood only in a ſpirituall ſenſe, but in an ordinary way, and litterally alſo; for Chriſt has his ſouldiers, that beſides their weapons of the right hand, <hi>their prayers, tears, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations,</hi> have alſo their weapons and armes of the left hand, as their ſwords and all warlike inſtruments, to fight for the honour, dignity, and ſoveraignty of their King and anointed Chriſt; who at his departure from his Diſciples, bad them ſell their coats, and buy each of them a ſword; by which he inveſted them with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as well to fight, if occaſion required, for the honour of their King and Maſter, and for their own ſafety; and although he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in <hi>Peter</hi> the temerarious and raſh uſe of his ſword, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:158558:40"/>bad him put it up for that time, yet the left the uſe of it to him and to the other Apoſtles, upon their juſt occaſions. And who knowes not that there is a time for warre and a time for peace, and God himſelf profeſſeth, that he is the Generall of the Armies of his people, and the Lord of their Hoſts; and he taught his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hands, in times paſt, to war and their fingers to fight, as they with thanks acknowledged. And he is the ſame God now to his people that ever he was, and will be nigh unto them, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help to all thoſe that fight his battels. And what, I pray, are ſo properly his batrels, as thoſe that are made againſt Antichriſt and his complices (by what names or titles ſo ever they be called) whether they be the Kings or Emperours of the Earth, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malignants that have given their power to the Beaſt and make warre againſt the Lambe? Neither ſhall I ever be of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde, but that it is the greateſt honour any Chriſtian can be called unto, to fight for his countrey and for the Goſpel againſt what enemy of either ſoever he be. And as I ſhall live and dye by Gods aſſiſtance in this opinion, ſo I ſhall likewiſe ever believe, that all ſuch as will neither fight for their countrey, nor religion, but deter and diſſwade others from it, are enemies of both, and ſo ought to be eſteemed, whatſoever pretences of ſeeming love they make to their countrey and religion: and that ſuch as will not fight for the proteſtant religion, deſerve not the favour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from thoſe States and countries they live in, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or ruine is all to them, ſo they may enjoy their owne ends and become maſters of thoſe they cauſeleſly hate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly and uncharitably think evill of; and whoſe diſtruction they not only daily wiſh and pray for, but as much as in them lyes, bid defiance to, and proclaime open warre againſt them; and uſe or rather abuſe the holy Scriptures for the maintenance of their authority, in their contending and fighting againſt their chriſtian Brethren, the Presbyterians, for their independency; and to that end in the Frontiſpieces of their books ſet downe Chriſts words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10 34.35, 36. where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Think not that I came to ſend peace on earth, I came not to ſend peace but a ſword. For I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her Mother, and the Daughter in law againſt her Mother in law, and a mans foes ſhall be thoſe of his own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi> Out of the which words miſunderſtood, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:158558:41"/>the people and make them believe, that they have good warrant and ground to fight againſt their Chriſtian Brethren for the maintenance of their own whimſies; whereas, although they had been Wolves in times paſt, yet being now Chriſtians indeed, and really converted, and in whom there is a through change wrought in their hearts, they would have laid aſide their wolviſh nature; ſo that the Wolfe and the Lambe would have peaceably dwelt together (according to the prediction of the Prophet) they then would be loving and kinde Brethren, and would not come out to fight againſt them: for that Scripture ſpeaketh only of ſuch, as who living and continuing in their naturall ſtate, and in an irregenerate and unconverted condition, and in whoſe ſouls the work of grace was not yet wrought, ſhold hate their very Parents, Brethren, and Siſters, and neareſt allies; that were truly converted to the faith and believed the Goſpell: as the ſeed of the Serpent will alwayes hate the ſeed of the Woman, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel;</hi> and that in regard of that enmity God hath put between them; ſo that the righteous is an abomination to the wicked, and the wicked to the righteous; be their relations never ſo nigh together, in reſpect either of conſanguinity or affinity: and this all Gods people by their daily experience finde, according to Chriſts prediction, <hi>That their foes and enemies are they of their own houſhold.</hi> But doe theſe words of Chriſt give liberty to thoſe that are Believers, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt High, the very ſonnes and daughters of God, to come out and make warre againſt their Brethren; and to fight againſt them, and that for their own inventions and traditions? I think not. And yet the Independents from this place of holy Scripture, not the Novices, Yonkers, and freſh-water ſouldiers only, but grave men in their great white basket-hilted beards, with their ſwords in their hands; come out to fight againſt their Brethren, for their <hi>Independency;</hi> and juſtifie this their grollery from Chriſts words: which if it be not to abuſe the holy Word of God, then nothing ever was an abuſe of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But they have a ſingular faculty in making every por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture ſerve their purpoſe: as where Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 13. verſ. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the straight gate,</hi> from thence they conclude, That the Independent-way is that ſtraight way, and that all Presbyterians being out of it, are in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:158558:41"/>the broad way that tends to perdition. But I will not abuſe the patience of the Reader with relating their dotage, as they abuſe the Scripture, to maintain their faction, and to ſpeak the truth it is no better: for they boaſt of ſuch a party in the kingdome (if their own words may be credited) as they now think by the ſword to be able to make their own Laws; and have been frequently heard ſay, That they had many abettors in the Aſſembly, and in both Houſes of Parliament, and in many parts through the Kingdome, beſides in all the Armies; and they were all reſolved to have the Liberty of their Conſciences, or elſe they would make uſe of their ſwords, which they have already in their hands. So that moſt certain it is, that the Religion of too to many of them, is a meer faction.</p>
            <p>And now I will take a little liberty to ſpeak ſomething upon my own experience about this buſineſſe: for at my return from my laſt Impriſonment, I having declared my different opinion from them in the point of Independency to many of that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and profeſſing that I looked upon many that went that way, as upon people truely fearing God, and ſuch as were his deer ſervants, (who I pittied to ſee ſo miſled) and yet for the way in which they went, I ingeniouſly told them, that I ſaw no ground for it in Gods Word; and that I purpoſed (God willing) to write ſomething concerning that ſubject, and that I doubted not to prove the Presbyterian way of Government to be Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and not Independency: notwithſtanding ſome of the Independents reported about the City, that I was of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and agreed with them in their opinion (which was not fairely done of them) but all this was acted to ſtrengthen their own party.</p>
            <p>But for ſuch of them as really beleeved that I intended to write ſomething, ſlighted it and made a meer puſh at it, exceedingly vilifying, and under valuing, what I could either ſay or doe againſt their Tenent; depending it ſeemes on their Champions ſtrength in the Aſſembly, who they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for ſuch great Schollers, as if nothing could bee ſet forth or written by mee, that they would not ſpeedily confute, and gloried as if the field were already wonne, and all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians vanquiſhed: and by ſuch expreſſions as theſe the party grew dayly more powerfull, and into that numeroſity it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:158558:42"/>now is. But in fine, ſome of their worthies who had a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable opinion of me, profeſt unto ſuch as were ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſlight me (for I had very good information of their underhand dealings) that if I did write againſt them, they were fully perſwaded that it would be more prejudiciall to their cauſe, than any thing writ before: and they pleaſed to ſpeak ſomething in the praiſe of my ſchollerſhip, that howſoever two or three Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the town made nothing of me, yet they knew very well that if I undertook and buſineſſe, I would mannage it with more learning than they that traduced me were able to judge of (and for their praiſes I was beholding to them) but they ſayd, the onely courſe would be for them, to take me off from that imployment and put me upon ſome other ſubject, or at leaſt to perſwade me to ſtand Neuter. All which was neither Chriſtianly nor candidly done of them. For if they had indeed had a deſire that the truth ſhould come to light: and if they had any reall opinion (as they pretended) either of my integrity in my religion, or of that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God had given me, they would have came to me rather, and have importuned me to write ſomething of that Subject, that they might ſee what reaſons I had to convince them, or to perſwade them, to have better thoughts of the Presbytry; for hitherto they had not received ſatisfaction from any that had formerly writ about it. But none of all this, but on the contrary, ſome of them very churliſhly and loftily demanded of me, what calling I had to meddle in Divinity, and to put my ſelf upon that imployment? Which I muſt confeſſe, was a queſtion that did not beſeem them of all other men: for they think that any gifted man, as they call them, may diſpute, write, and preach, not onely privately, but in a publike way; and glory that the very boyes and women in the Congregations can confute the learnedeſt of the Presbyterians; and many of them, as it is well known, that were none of their Paſtors, have ſet forth many ſcurrilous and blaſphemous pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets in defence of their Independency, which have been allowed of by them with great applauſe; and that theſe men now ſhould demand of me, what calling I had to defend any truth in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon againſt the errors of the times, I ſay it may ſeem ſtrange to any rationall man. But for anſwer in brief, though I am not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to pleaſe them in all things; let them take notice of this: That if it be lawfull in any of their fraternities to maintain their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:158558:42"/>erronious opinions, it is likewiſe lawfull in any other Chriſtians to oppoſe them and to defend their truth: for they alſo muſt give an account, how they have imployed all thoſe ſeverall talents of knowledge, learning, or any other thing God hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and this they alſo in their Pamphlets frequently make mention of, to warrant their ſcribling in divinity. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourth of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> verſ. 6. Saith, <hi>Let your ſpeech be alwayes with grace, ſcaſoned with ſalt, that you may know how to anſwer every man.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15. Saith, <hi>ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſſe and fear.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philip. chapt.</hi> the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Onely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be as it becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt: that whether I come and ſee you, or elſe be abſent, I may hear of your affaires; that ye ſtand fast in on ſpirit, with one minde, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpell.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epiſtle Generall <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Exhorteth all Chriſtians, <hi>That they ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places to this purpoſe might be produced which warrants Chriſtians, that they may ſtrive for the faith, and earneſtly contend for it againſt what enemies of it ſo ever; and in ſpeciall we are command, that we ſhould be alwayes ready to give an anſwer to every man that asketh us a reaſon of our hope, and that we ſhould know how to anſwer every man. Now then when many of the Independents came to me, and asked a reaſon of my faith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Presbytery, I demande of any well-grounded Chriſtian, whether or no I have not a very good calling to anſwer them; which when they are ſo much diſpleaſed at me, and ſo highly magnifie it in their own party; I have very good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they contend not for truth, but for victory, and to make a faction and diviſion in Church and State. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. verſ. 2. ſpeaking of the falſe Teachers of his time, that but urged the ceremoniall Law, <hi>Cals them Dogs,</hi> and bids them take heed of them, <hi>Beware,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of Dogs, beware of evill workers, beware of the conciſion;</hi> all ſuch were to be taken heed of, as made diviſions, and cut the Church into little pieces, and ſucking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and therefore are called, <hi>them of the conciſion:</hi> for they indeed made ſeparations; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:158558:43"/>of them, as of a company of doggs that are ever ſnarling or biting; and as of evill workers, that ſpoyled the work of the Goſpell; which was to unite men firſt to God, and then one to another; that they might be of one ſpirit and one minde; and theſe evill workers divided them all one from another and made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and therefore they and all ſuch as they are, are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and abhorred, that make ſtrifes and diviſions in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Countries where they are, while they contend for their own novelties and new born truths: and all thoſe that oppoſe them have a call from God and his Word for their warrant, in their ſo doing. But others of them carried themſelves as more craftily, ſo more gentily, and ſeemed to come to me in the way of love, pretending they honoured me; and they demanded of me, Whether or no I intended to practice Phyſick again? and told me, that if I had ſuch a purpoſe, they would yeeld me their beſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance for the procuring of me Patients; for which their love, I returned them many thanks, telling them withall; that for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of Phyſick, I had little hopes of doing any good that way in the City; for ſome Independent Doctors of Phyſick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had ſo villified me amongſt all good people, and had made ſuch a peece of ignorance or nothing of me, in that faculty, as they had taken away my reputation, in as much as in them lay: ſo that were my skill or knowledge in that Art, never ſo great, yet I might not in this place ever expect to regain any eſteem in it: (ſo powerfull all black-mouths are to darken any mans credit) though I bleſſe God, I had known, as well what belonged unto that faculty, as they that maligned me; and had through his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, done as great cures as ever they did any; and added far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I doubted not in time to make it appear, that thoſe that had ſo abuſed me, had neither honeſty nor learning in them: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the world eſteemed of them for their ſeeming Religion, which they had ever made uſe of, but for their baſe and covetous ends. And they demanding the names of thoſe men; I told them ingenuouſly, and that their calumnies were one of the chiefe cauſes of the ruin of me and my poor family; as I could prove by a cloud of witneſſes, if that could do me any good: to which they replyed, they were very ſorry, and confeſt that thoſe men were never heard ſpeak well of any, and that which makes me wonder, I never came in the company, nor never changed a word
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:158558:43"/>with them that thus traduced me. But then they offered their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto me, and profeſt they ſhould be very willing to do me any curteſie that lay in their power, to get me ſome honourable imployment by which I might comfortably ſupport my family, for they thought that my means was not great (and they thought truly in that) and they knew that the charity of many was now waxed cold, and that ſince my being at <hi>London</hi> there was a great change of mens mindes, and thoſe that were formerly my friends went now another way; and they heard that I was for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, which they conceived would be worſe then the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government; and if I ſhould write any thing in the defence of that cauſe, that then I would totally loſe thoſe that as yet were well affected to me (as afterwards they reported I was utterly loſt) and they would perſwade me to imploy my ſelfe any other way, then in writing about that ſubject, for it would give great diſcontent unto Gods people. And if I intended any publick imployment, ſuch men, they told me, with one word of their mouthes could gratifie me, and get me into ſome honourable way of advancement, that I might comfortably ſupport my family: withall they told me, that they were moſt aſſured, that I ſhould obtaine any reaſonable requeſt of them, for they had heard them ſpeak exceeding well of me, and were ſorry to ſee that as yet there had been no recompence or ſatisfaction made me, for all my loſſes and ſufferings; for which their good reſpects towards me, I told them I was exceedingly beholding unto them: Now all theſe they would have had me applyed my ſelf unto, were Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendents. And for that time I told them, that I never as yet had hunted after promotion, and if any could do me any good, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Parliament it ſelf was as likely to doe it as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and although I had not hitherto ſolicited the honourable Houſe, neither of the Peers or Commons, yet I would rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the houſe, then go by private wayes, and told them that as I ſaw opportunity, I ſhould more willingly make my addreſſes to the Parliament then to any particular perſons, though I ſhould count it a great favour to injoy any mans good opinion and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, and for the which I ſhould ever be thankfull. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they exceedingly urged me to make uſe of thoſe men they had nomitated to me, as men moſt powerfull with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Now I perceived very well their drift in it: for if I had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:158558:44"/>applyed my ſelfe to them (which I never did) and if they had done me any favour, and if I had afterwards writ againſt their fond opinion, then I ſhould have been counted the moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fellow in the world; and then alſo they would not only have defamed me, but as they had the power to advance me, they would have uſed the ſame to have caſt me down againe, which I very well foreſaw. Againe, if I had intreated their aſſiſtance; and if they upon any falſe information had refuſed it; if then I had writ againſt Independency, they would have accuſed me, that it had been out of diſcontent, becauſe I could not attaine to my own ends by them, and becauſe they would not ſatisfie my humour; and that I did all I did, out of ill will and malice, and then they would have laid a load of calumnies upon me; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of all which reaſons, I would no way be induced to make any Independents a meanes and way of my preferment. But ſtood unmoveably to my reſolution, to write in defence of the truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the novelties of the Independents, and told them ſo. Then they ſet upon me with freſh incounters as often as they came to me, and whereſoever they met me, and importuned me againe and againe, that I would not meddle, but that I would ſtand a neuter: and that I ſhould conſider withall, that all thoſe that went that way had been my very good friends and contributed to my neceſſities, and ſtuck cloſe to me in all my diſtreſſes, and that they were the deer ſervants of God; and that if I ſhould now write in the defence of the Presbytery, which they ſo much hated, that I would ſad the hearts of the Saints; and therefore they did earneſtly deſire me that I would not be ſeen in that cauſe. My anſwer to them in this regard was this, that I would not with <hi>Eſau</hi> ſell my birth-right for a meſſe of Porrage: if any of them had done me any curteſie, they had my thanks for it, and my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and my readineſſe to gratifie any of them againe in what I could: and if I could never requite them here, they were to have their reward in Heaven for it, which would recompence all; but I further added, that when they ſhewed me all thoſe favours, they were of my minde, and were in the very way that now I am in, and relieved me under that notion. So that I ſaw no reaſon why they ſhould be ſo much diſpleaſed with me for my conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as I might juſtly be offended with them for their inſtability and levity, notwithſtanding their curteſies: and withall I related
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:158558:44"/>unto them, that it was an unreaſonable thing in any man, and an unjuſt thing to goe about to ſtop the mouth of truth with a bribe; or to retard any man from doing his duty, with the memory of former curteſies: for no ingenuous man will ever do any a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, to captivate him or make him a ſlave to him for ever for it: and if any ſhould be ſo baſe, as by any favour to go about to ſilence truth, yet it was the honour of any man ever to preſerve his chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, which is more to be prized then all worldly things: and therefore I deſired them, that if they tendred their own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the honour of their cauſe, that they would never any more make mention of what favours I had received, as if that ſhould hinder me from my dutie, or deprive me of my libertie, which I preferred before my life: and I further related unto them, that many of the Independents already had often caſt in my teeth their former curteſies, and againſt all the lawes of civility had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me and Mr. <hi>Prynne;</hi> telling me to my face, that neither he nor I ſuffered for the cauſe of God, but for our own ends; and that we had forgot all that the people of God had done for us; and were now turned perſecutors of the wayes of God, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves very ungratefull to our Benefactors; and a thouſand ſuch uncivill and injurious things they have told me to my face in a violent and unchriſtian manner: ſo that the very upbraiding of us with their former favours is a ſufficient payment for them (though by the way I will take liberty to ſpeak it, and that in the preſence of God) that their favours, though more then ever I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, were not a quarter of that they were reported, nor never equalized my very loſſes: ſo that at this day (as ſome of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can tell, that knowes my eſtate to five ſhillings) I have not in the world by ſome hundreds of pounds, ſo much as my father left me, for the ſupport of me and mine, whatſoever men may ſpeak: but this is one of the greateſt ſlaveries upon the earth, that theſe men would bring upon people, that by their curteſies they think for ever to make them their Vaſſels, and that they muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak nor write any thing in defence of any knowne truth, that is diſpleaſing unto them; and ſuch a ſervitude as I will never be brought unto, for the enjoying of whatſoever the world can afford me. I know many that has forſaken the truth, and changed their religion for bread, and deſerted their friens for a thing of naught. But whereas they told me withall, that I would ſad the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:158558:45"/>hearts of the Saints, if I write in defence of the Presbytery: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that I had thought that all the Independents had hated Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, and how now they were come to impropriate and to attribute unto themſelves only, the name of Saints, I ſaw no good ground or reaſon for it: yea, I told them it was both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and Phariſaicall; unchriſtian, in regard that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians were their Brethren, and redeemed with the ſame price, and were believers as well as any Independents; and ſerved their Lord and Maſter with as much ſincerity as any of them; &amp; ſhould be as willing to ſuffer for the Goſpell, or any truth of it, as any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, and ſtand to it when they would run away; and therefore they did very unchriſtianly to un-Saint their Brethren, and Phariſaically boaſt of their own Sanctity, magnifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whileſt they vilified others: but they might remember what our Saviour told them, that what was prized amongſt men, was not eſteemed of by God, and that ſuch as advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould be brought downe, and thoſe that juſtified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before men, were not juſtified before God: and therefore I counſelled them to lay aſide all high thoughts of themſelvs, and to think a little better of their Brethren the Presbyterians, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they were Saints alſo; and wiſht them to take heed that they did not by their ſcurrilous and blaſphemous writings in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their novelties and Independency, ſad the hearts of thoſe that were Saints indeed: but for a ſatisfactory anſwer I told them plainly, that if the defence of the Goſpell or any truth of it would ſad the hearts of either Saints or Angels, I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it, for I was to pleaſe God and not men; for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. So I may ſay in this cauſe, <hi>If I yet pleaſed men I ſhold not be the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> &amp; therfore in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of truth, I told them I would only aime at the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and how it might pleaſe him. And notwithſtanding my reſolution, upon all occaſions they ſolicited me that I would ſtand a Neuter, and uſed ſome more reaſons to move me to it; telling me, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> by medling in that buſineſſe, had loſt the love of all Gods people, and was now grown odious amongſt them; inſomuch that they called all his former ſufferings in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and doubted of the reality of his religion; and therefore they feared if I ſhould intermeddle in that quarrell, it would be very prejudiciall unto me; and therefore they deſired me as I tendred mine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:158558:45"/>own good, and the good of mine, I would not appear in that cauſe but ſtand a Neuter. To all which <hi>I</hi> thus anſwered: that to ſtand as Neuter in this buſineſſe <hi>I</hi> ſhould make my ſelfe hatefull to God and man: for God himſelf ſaith, he will ſpew out of his mouth all thoſe that are Luke-warme, that are neither hot nor cold, in the number of which are all Neuters; and by this <hi>I</hi> ſhould make my ſelf liable to Gods wrath, whiles <hi>I</hi> ſhould gratifie them: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>I</hi> told them, that <hi>I</hi> had learned ſomething of the brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Kings Armie (whileſt <hi>I</hi> was a priſoner amongſt them) who were wont ordinarily to ſay, that of all men in the world they hated thoſe that plaid the knaves on both ſides, as <hi>Chomley, Grinvile,</hi> and the <hi>Hothams</hi> did, who for their own private ends would betray their countries and the truſt committed to them, and of all men they would have ſuch hanged: and next unto them they would have all thoſe that now are or have beene Neuters through the Kingdome, whoſoever came to get the day, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the verieſt Rogues and baſe Villaines in the world; and all ſuch men, as when they were amongſt the Cavaliers, would be for the King, and when they were amongſt the Parliamenteers, would be for the Parliament: all ſuch men, <hi>I</hi> told them, amongſt the moſt brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army, and ſuch as were worthy of honour, were proclaimed the very Vermine of the world, and ſuch as in their opinion they thought unworthy of any conquerours favour, or to be eſteemed any otherwiſe of, then of a company of knaves and cowards to all poſterity. And <hi>I</hi> told them, that <hi>I</hi> thought thoſe Gentlemen in their opinion err'd not: for <hi>I</hi> ſhall ever believe, that all thoſe that are Neuters through the kingdome even in theſe civill broyles, and that are of no ſide, are the worſt of men; and that by their neutrality of all ſides, they are the mundungos and garbige of man-kinde: and much more are they deteſtable before God &amp; the world, that are Neuters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or for baſe ends either hold their peace, or make profeſſion of any religion: &amp; therefore <hi>I</hi> was reſolved ſincerely to go to work, and to declare my minde in that way <hi>I</hi> conceived to be the truth, and to live and dye in it, though <hi>I</hi> were expoſed by it to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt myſerie that ever man underwent. And whereas they told me that M. <hi>Prynne</hi> had ſo loſt the favour of the people for declaring of his opinion againſt Independency, that they called in queſtion all his ſufferings, and could not give him ſo much as a good word:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:158558:46"/>I ſaid in that they ſhewed their levity and vanity, not knowing either wherefore they loved, or wherefore they hated him; for he was ſtill the ſame, that ever he was, and notwithſtanding all their malice and reproaches, for the good ſervice he had done to his God, and to his country, he hath deſerved an immortall name to all future ages; and is as truely at this day beloved and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all ſuch as know what to honour and love men for, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was; and in ſpight of all the calumnies of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he will walk like a noble Lyon, when they ſhall go like a company of Moon-Calves, bleating out their own folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and changing their opinions and affections every moneth. It is obſerved, and that ordinarily that the generality of all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, never love without doting; nor never praiſe without admiring, but as they are won with an apple ſo they are loſt with a nut; no man knows were to finde them in one minde for a moneths ſpace, for as the hornes of any new light appears, either to the praiſe or diſ-praiſe of any, they muſt follow that light; ſuch a generation of Moon-Calves, and ſuch an unſtable Sect never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the world before; and therefore I told them I ſhould never be terrified with what they had either ſpake or writ againſt Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> from my duty in defence of the truth, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to bauk, neither for hope of the favour nor fear of the anger of all the Independents in the world: for whatſoever could be prejudiciall to me for doing any duty in regard of them, it muſt be either in reſpect of name or means: and I told them that whatſoever ſhould be prejudiciall unto me undeſervedly, it ſhould never trouble me, whether it were in regard of my reputation or of my eſtate: as for infamy and reproach I ſaid there was no fence againſt them in the ſchool of wit or Art, and that I had already had my ſhare in all manner of calumnies, and had been ſo often wounded with them by all ſorts of people, as I beleeved there was ſcarſe a narrow left in the quiver of malice, that they could now ſhoot at me, or ſcarſe any reproach or contumely that ever was coyned in the mint of mens hatred, that had not paſt as currant through the world againſt me, ſo that now I was ſo uſed unto it that there was no leſſon more perfect unto me, and I had learned quietly to go through good report and bad report: and I knew it had been the lot of all the Prophets, ſome of the which confeſt that their hearts were broke with reproaches: yea, the Lord of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:158558:46"/>life himſelf eſcaped not free from prodigious and blaſphemous reproaches, who was counted a wine-bibber and a friend of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and one that had a devill, and all the Apoſtles had taſted and drunk of that cup; and all the Primitive Chriſtians had been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after the ſame manner, and that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers in that age of the world, had his <hi>Cocleus</hi> to rail of him; and <hi>Calvin</hi> had a <hi>Bolſecus</hi> to abuſe him: and all our holy Martyrs here in <hi>England,</hi> had thoſe that moſt impiouſly traduced them; and ſo had the poor Puritans and all that ſtood up for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their ſeverall generations, thoſe that both maligned and reviled them, as all the precious and godly people at this day, by the Independents and all Sectaries, and all manner of Malignants are cauſeleſly traduced; and therefore I muſt never look for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure at their hands, then all the godly that ever lived; who all went to heaven through many afflictions: <hi>And all they</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that will live godly in Christ Ieſus, muſt go through many afflictions;</hi> and it is not the leſt, but indeed one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be reproached and railed on; yea, it is worſe then death it ſelf: for he that takes away a mans good name, is worſe then <hi>Cain,</hi> for he in killing his brother, made him live for ever and eternalized his name; but they that take away mens reputations kill them alive; and ruin them and their poſterity; which as it is a fearfull ſin, ſo the frequenteſt in the world, every man making it his occupation to reproach and vilifie thoſe they bear a malice to, as all the Independents and Sectaries dayly to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and againſt any that ſtand forth to oppoſe their Novelties, and I being in the number of thoſe that reſolve to the laſt period of my life to maintain truth againſt falſhood, expect and look for no leſſe favour at all Malignants hands and tongues then all the generations of the juſt have found before me: and therefore I bleſſe God, I have before-hand, ſate down and counted with my ſelf, what my love to the truth will coſt me, from all the enemies of it, in reſpect of my reputation and name; and have learned of my King and Maſter, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad; yea, to leap for joy, when I am reviled and ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for his names ſake, for ſo he hath commanded me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. And if I ſuffer in regard of my eſtate by this my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I know in whom I have ever truſted, and in whom now I beleeve, and <hi>that I came naked into the world, and that naked I
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:158558:47"/>ſhall go out:</hi> and if my God gives me food and raiment, <hi>I have learned to be content:</hi> for the riches of this world are but like the Mannathat fell about the Tents of the Iſraelites, thoſe that gathered more of it had but enough to ſerve their turn, or if they gathered more it was but a trouble and annoyance to them, and they that gathered leſſe had no want. And truely he that would but look upon the world at this time, and behold with attention the inſtability of all theſe things under the ſun, he would have little cauſe to confide in uncertain riches; for they may dayly ſee many men rich in the morning, and all beggers at night, and they that were beggers in the forenoon made rich in the evening, and within two dayes after, they ſhall ſee the ſame men lye naked and dead upon the ground, and deprived of all and life it ſelf; ſo that there is no man can promiſe unto himſelfe proſperity or the ſtability or poſſeſſion of any thing a day, neither by ſea nor land, and therefore he that is inamored with the world cannot be a friend to God, <hi>For the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, and therefore through Gods goodneſſe I have learned Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Leſſon, <hi>To be contented in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for, <hi>I am crucified unto the world, and the world to me:</hi> and will not for the love of that, deſert my love to the truth or fear to defend it, for fear of loſing any thing in my eſtate, but will roul my ſelf upon Gods Providence, and commit my ſoul and my wayes unto him who is the <hi>Preſerver of all, eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Theſe and many ſuch paſſages did I relate unto many of thoſe that would have deterred me from writing in defence of the Presbytry againſt Independency, and yet they ſtill continued dayly to ſollicet me not to ſet forth my book againſt that way: and although I told them again and again that I was reſolved to publiſh my opinion, they intreated me then that <hi>I</hi> would tarry but till the Reaſons and Grounds of their way were publiſhed, which they ſay would be in a ſhort time: and all this was contrived to ſtrengthen their faction, and to anticipate the people, and ſettle them in their Novelties againſt whatſoever ſhould be publiſhed againſt their doctrine of Independency. And when they heard that my book was gone to the Preſſe, it would exceed beleef, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould recite all the paſſages of their under-hand dealings in that buſineſſe, and how diligent ſome of them were about the Preſſe, and how they went about reproaching
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:158558:47"/>me and it, and all to make it hatefull and odious to all, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre the people from reading of it, or regarding of it: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any of them met me they told me it ſhould be anſwered; yea, ſome of them reported that there was already an anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to come forth as ſoon as mine. It ſeemes theſe men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with themſelves be it right or wrong to maintain their Faction, and uphold their party: yet I am confident through the ſtrength and power of my God, that I ſhall ever be able to reply to whatſoever they can ſay: but this I will ſay for them, as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in ſubtilty and cunning craſtines, exceeded all the other Monks and Fryers that went before them; ſo the Independents in their generations, are more cunning then ever any Sectaries in former ages, for they have got into their hands the prime Lectures of the Kingdome, and run through all the Towns and Cities through the Realm, and through all the Armies, to make Proſelites, and have ſo ſcattered their Independent phantaſies, that now there is ſcarce a Town or City, where their leavon hath not ſowred the whole lump of true and ſound doctrine: and they have got the ſtart of all the Puritans in all the foregoing Generations; for they were of ſuch auſtere lives and men ſo alineated from the world that you might know them by the hair of the heads and faces, and by their habits from all other men, whereſoever you meet them, for commonly they were ever out of faſhion when others were in it, and they had all their haires clipt as cloſe to their heads as a company of fighting cocks have their feathers, and they uſually went in a great Patriarchicall beards, and for ſilks, and velvets, and pluſh, and ſattin, and brave aparrell, they thought they were for Kings houſes; and contented themſelves with their rurall weeds: which auſterity of theirs made them leſſe eſteemed by the great men of the world, and their doctrine leſſe regarded, and as it was in our Saviours time, <hi>That the poor received the Goſpell;</hi> ſo in our fore-fathers dayes, the Puritans commonly were by the worldlings and prophane, counted but a company of obſcure and beggerly fellows: but our Independent Miniſters, as they ſay, they have learned the leſſon of their Chriſtian liberty, and tell their Diſciples that the Saints are the right owners of all things beneath, and that it is for the honour of Religion to go brave and gallant, and that this is a great grace to the Goſpell and for themſelves, whereas the ancient Puritan Miniſters went with their hair as cloſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:158558:48"/>clipt as cocks of the game, and their wives went in plain and modeſt attire and both they &amp; their wives very humble, and never came in a rich coach: the Independent Miniſters are very finicall and go in their hair and in their habits, out of town like Cavaliers, ſo that none that meets them would take them for miniſters, but rather thinke them a company of ruffians: and for their wives they ordinarily go as brave as the daintieſt dames in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and both they and their conſorts are commonly as proud and ſupercilious as any of the ſecular race: and for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for the moſt part, they are very great and honourable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages or at leaſt very rich, and they are all their familiars, for poor folke, they may in private accoſt them, and perhaps they will grace them with a little communication, but this muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, as a high favour. And if at any time theſe Independent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters meet but with a poor aged Presbyter, riding to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but on a Horſe worth ſix ſhillings, they will ſalute him with, <hi>Good morrow my Lord Biſhop;</hi> whereas they can ride thither mounted upon ſtately Geldings; and ye ſhall frequently ſee them amongſt Lords and Ladies both they and their brave wives carried about in Coaches with four Horſes, in great ſtate; whereas a Wheele-barrow, ſuch as they trundle White-wine-vinegar on, were a great deale fitter for them, except they deſerved better from Church and State. But it is a wonderfull thing to ſee the vanity and levity of the people how they run after theſe men, and neglect their moſt faithfulleſt, laborious, and orthodox Miniſters, and by whoſe diligent paines they have been begotten to the faith, and how now in compariſon of the Independent Miniſters they are ſlighted: whereas there is not one of a hundred of them, but has more reall and true learning in them, then all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents put together; for, excepting Mr. <hi>Grinehill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> who I have ever honoured, as grave, godly, learned Miniſters, and which is their honour, humble Gentlemen, I never ſo much as heard of any fame of the other either at home or abroad for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learning of eminency, or any thing but pride, that makes men famous; and if they had not been accidentally Members of the Aſſembly, and Fautors of this new Faction, they would all of them have gone out of the World in obſcurity: and yet ſuch is the vanity and levity of the people, that they in mighty crowds runne after them, and flight their owne pious and painfull Preachers,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:158558:48"/>from whom they might ever: be ſure to heare nothing but ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and true doctrine, &amp; that that tended to peace, not to faction. And I can truly ſay, though many of them now are caſt behinde the doore as broken Veſſels, yet in all the time of the Prelates do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, they continued conſtantly in their miniſtery, and many of them ſuffered impriſonment and bonds, and moſt of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when theſe ran all away. And I can ſay more; that if we examine their Sermons either as they preach them or as they are in print, ſince the Apoſtles times there was nothing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely preached or penn'd, whether for information of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reformation in mens lives and manners; and for the convincing of all Hereſies, Errors, or Schiſmes, and that more tended to ſanctification then that they both preach and print: and for inſtance, to omit many of their learned works, let any man but with judgement reade that Treatiſe of M. <hi>George Walker</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Watlin street,</hi> intituled, <hi>The Doctrine of the Sabbath;</hi> and ſhew me ſuch a piece of Divine Learning writ by any Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Miniſter; nay, I dare boldly ſay, if they were all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they cannot make ſuch a piece for excellent learning; the ſame we may ſay of his orthodox preaching in his ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: and the ſame may be ſaid of Learned Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> both Miniſters in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> and of many hundred more through the City and Country; who for their moſt godly, learned, profitable, and painefull miniſtery, equalize any almoſt ſince the Apoſtles time; yet all theſe men under the name of Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are ſlighted, neglected, and now made nothing of in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of our Independent Noveliſts; who have got an art, not only to diſgrace all other Miniſters under the name of Presbyterians, &amp; <hi>Baals Prieſts,</hi> Perſecutors, &amp;c. but alſo to ſtrengthen their faction, as if authority be not ſpeedily carefull to ſuppreſſe their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and novelties, they wil make the whole Kingdome depend upon them, and be their ſervants ere long. They have of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters before them, got the way of pleaſing great perſonages, and eſpecially the ſilly Women; for they preach unto them liberty of conſcience and liberty of the creature, in a moſt ample and large manner; ſo that all bravely which amongſt the Puritans in times paſt was thought a ſcandall to religion, is now thought a grace and honour of the Goſpel; inſomuch that all the gallant Ladies are all, or moſt of them Independents; never were there any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:158558:49"/>that pleaſed Ladies better: ſo that whereas in Chriſts time the poor received the Goſpell, and the Phariſees were wont to ſay, that none but the curſed people followed Chriſt, meaning the poor; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, not many mighty, but the poore and mean things hath God choſen; and the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> were uſually called the poor men of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the Puritans were all counted a company of poor fellows; now the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miniſters they have got all the rich ſheep from out of their fellow Paſtors folds, it ſeems they are the beſt Purvey ours for the kingdome of Heaven; they have already got abundance of rich Saints in theſe latter dayes; ſo that when the World groweth pooreſt, the Independent-churches and congregations and their Paſtors, grow all richeſt; and I am afraid they will make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of a great many more ſimple Ewes, if their Watchmen and Paſtors be not the more carefull and vigilant to look to their flocks; for they have a ſingular faculty of plundering, and have their Emiſſaries for that purpoſe in all the parts of the Kingdome, and yet the World is ſo blinde they cannot diſcerne into the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of theſe men. They blame in the Papiſts, as it is blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy indeed, that they not only Lord it over Gods heritage by their own tyrannicall traditions, but for that they moſt ſacrilegiouſly mutilate the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and take away the Cup from the people, and they notwithſtanding are guilty of both theſe crimes in a more deep manner then the Papiſts: for they impoſe in a moſt Lordly manner their traditions and novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Gods own lawes upon the people, and not as traditions; and they take not away the cup only from the people, but take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way both the bread and wine from them alſo, and that from the deer ſervants of God, and from ſuch as againſt whom either for their knowledge or converſation they have no juſt exception: and debar both men and women through beleevers and ſuch as are baptized from the Sacrament, and deny baptiſme the feal of the Covenant to their Children; then the which, ſhew me in the world either a greater and more Lordly tyranny, or a more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſacriledge! And this and many more ſuch inſolencies of their Lording it over Gods heritage, might be inſtanced to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and the Goſpell, and yet the people have not eyes to ſee it, nor hearts to conſider, what a yoak of ſlavery they have voluntarily now put themſelves under, when by the exceeding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:158558:49"/>kindneſſe of God towards us, and through the wiſdome and help of this Parliament, we were freed from the unſupportable yoak and tyranny of the Prelates. Truely when I read their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and blaſphemous Pamphlets, and when I hear their bitter expreſſions, both againſt the Parliament and Presbytery, and all their Chriſtian brethren whom they ſtile Presbyterians and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the wayes of God: and when I conſider their Lording of it over their brethren, and their under-hand practiſes, for the upholding of their Faction, and their unchriſtian dealing in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; I have admired the patience of the great God, and the humanity of the people: I ſay I have admired the patience of the great God, that hath no more ſeverely puniſhed this Nation, for their ſo great ungratitude towards him for his longanimity and ſo many deliverances of us, both from our Enemies and from our feares, and for thoſe unheard of blaſphemies both againſt his Divine Majeſty and all authority, they dayly utter; beſides their deſpiſing of his Miniſters and Ordinances: and I have alſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to ſee the lenity and curteſie of the people towards theſe men, that although both in their preachings and in their writings they proclaim them all enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome, and thruſt them all from the holy things, and count of them all as a company of Infidels; they yet endure all their abuſes with moderation, neither do I think that the humanity of this Nation towards them, can be parallell'd by any other country under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; who, I am moſt aſſured, would never have ſuffered half thoſe inſolencies they dayly exerciſe towards them. And yet I dare ſay, for all the godly Presbyterians in <hi>England</hi> whom they count ſuch perſecutors, there is not one of them that deſires a hair of any of their heads ſhould fall to their detriment, or that would not be as ſorry that any evill ſhould betide any of them as they would be glad and rejoyce to ſee them return again into the boſome of the Church, that they might live in love &amp; unity as they ought, and formerly they have done, and joyn all their prayers and forces unanimouſly againſt the common enemies of Chriſt and his Goſpell, and ſo take away the ſcandall they have already given, and heale up all thoſe breaches, that by their wantonneſſe in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have been made to the great diſhonour of God.</p>
            <p>And if there were any ſpark of godly love, or any bowels of compaſſion in our brethren towards their Chriſtian brethren
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:158558:50"/>and towards their countrey, they would eaſily be induced now to make up all breaches, and lay aſide all thoſe novelties that have proved ſo pernitious already to us all. For what is it that any thankfull Chriſtian can deſire that God hath not done for us? He hath delivered his people in this famous City, and in many other parts of the Kingdome from the Antichriſtian yoake, and from all the ceremonies and what ſoever was really offenſive to tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and by his Divine providence has put it into the hearts of the great Counſell to make ſuch Ordinances as by which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are inabled through the Kingdome to admit of none to the Sacrament, but ſuch as for their knowledge and godly life, ſhall be thought ſit communicants; ſo that now there is no juſt cauſe of ſeparation from our Aſſemblies, ſeeing all ſcandals are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Goſpell is preached in ſuch purity as it never was ſince the Apoſtles times; and that by as godly, orthodox, painfull, and able Miniſters as any are in the World. Why therefore ſhould our Brethren ſo ſlight what God hath done for us, and count all that nothing without they may eſtabliſh a bondage unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more heavie, then ever yet lay upon any mans ſhoulders as ſurely their Independency will prove? For the people, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves I have that confidence in them, ſuch is my opinion of their moderation, that when they ſhall duly and upon deliberation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſad effects theſe Noveliſts have already brought forth, they will relinguiſh them and give God thanks that the danger of them was ſo timely diſcovered, and they will againe returne into the boſome of the Church and follow their own Miniſters, and by whom they ſhall be built up in their holy faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fed with the ſincere milke of the Word, and with ſuch wholſome doctrine as tends both to the peace of their own ſouls, and the quiet of Church and ſtate. But that they may at laſt get their feet out of the ſnare, and free themſelves from their ſlavery and bondage; I ſhall deſire them but to conſider a little the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the Independent Miniſters both in former times and in theſe our dayes, and how faire we offer them, and then I am moſt aſſured they will ſee juſt cauſe of changing their opinions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning againe with love and amity into the fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that people who are as truly fearers of God, and thoſe that deſire Chriſt may be ſet up as King upon his Throne, and may for ever rule and raigne in all mens hearts, as any of thoſe that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:158558:50"/>make the greateſt noiſe of it, as if they were the only men that advanced Chriſts kingdome; whereas on the contrary in as much as in them lyes, they have rent the ſeamleſſe garment of the Church in pieces, and rejoyce at nothing more then to hear and ſee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions amongſt Brethren. For if we conſider their former practiſes, and the mutability of many of the Independent Miniſters (a very few of them excepted) they either ranne away when they ſhould have ſtood to the cauſe, or elſe temporized, and that deeply; a crime they lay upon their Brethren the Presbyterians: and ſo changeable they were in their opinions, as they manifeſted unto the world, that they were unſtable in all their wayes, and this many of their followers have themſelves confeſt, although they now palliate it over, that whatſoever they have formerly done, was in regard that the truth was obſcured and darkned, through the cunning of the Popiſh and Prelaticall faction, and that all men were kept hood winckt and could not rightly diſcerne it in its full glory and luſtre, till this ſunſhine of liberty had now againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and ſent its raies amongſt us, by means of which they ſay they are ſo illuminated, as now they have got the ſpirit of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by vertue of their New-lights they well perceive their former errors and miſtakes; and have found that the way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency is that way of Church-government that God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his holy Word. This many of their Diſciples plead in defence of their Miniſters, which to ſay the truth is nothing: for the ſame may be alleaged and pretended by all Hereticks and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries whatſoever, who will never want the ſame or the like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſo there will ever be a way for the broaching of all new doctrines, be they never ſo pernicious to the truth, and never ſo diſtructive to all governement. But notwithſtanding, what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they or their Diſciples now can ſpeak in their behalfe, it is very fit that their former practiſes in their ſeverall places in reſpect of their religion ſhould be conſidered by all judicious and godly men, who know that conſtancy and perſeverance in the faith is that that crowneth all; for he that <hi>perſevereth unto the end, he ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; not ſuch as ſtart back like a broken Bow and are never ſtable: and as for ſome of them, it is well known they have been in one ſit great conforming Proteſtants, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mood great favourers of the <hi>Socinian</hi> tenents; and for their factious ſpirits and oppoſition to the Puritanicall way, were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:158558:51"/>favoured and countenanced by the Prelates; and then at another time they were Puritans, and that trade growing out of date, and Independency beginning to be in vogue, they are now of that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and are as great ſticklers in defence of it, as the ſilver-Smiths of the godeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> were for the upholding of their craft, and what next they will be, the God of heaven onely knoweth, for they will ever be following their new lights. Others of them were very Prelaticall, and as much aſpired to Church-preferment, if the greateſt men in the Kingdome be not deceived, and ſome of their own party miſtaken, as any other; but failing of their expectation, and falling into diſcontent, turned Puritans; and that weather-beaten Religion, being now with too too many grown ſtale, they are at this inſtant great Independents, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſupream Champions for that Faction: and there is ſcarce a man of them, but has been on all ſides (whatſoever they make the world now beleeve) according as their occaſions ſerved, and have ever been attempting to bring in one Novelty or other, or have laboured to revive ſome hereſie, or ſome miraculous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and all to the diſturbance of the Church, and for the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reformation. And therefore all judicious and godly Chriſtians, ought duly to weigh and conſider with themſelves, that ſuch unſtable men as theſe are, and have been, are no guides to be followed: for as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, they will both fall into the ditch.</hi> They ſhould therefore remember what Chriſt ſaid to the people concerning <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist: what (ſaith he) went ye out into the wilderneſſe to ſee? a reed ſhaken with the wind? Luke</hi> 7.24. intimating unto the people, that ſollid, ſtable, and Orthodox Miniſters in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould be ſuch as the people ought to follow, and liſten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and not thoſe reeds and unſtable men, that are turned about with every new winde of Doctrine, and moved with every ſtream of opinion, and ſuch as follow every new light, and that many times for baſe and wordly ends. So that when moſt of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Miniſters are, and have been ſuch, they ought not any longer by the people to be followed. They ſhould alſo conſider their inſtability not onely in Religion, but in the publike affaires; they may remember how zealous theſe men were for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> not long ſince, and how forward they were to promote the publike good, and to advance the honour, dignity, and priviledges
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:158558:51"/>of the great Councell, and what admirers and lovers not many years ſince, they were of our brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> and of our noble and brave Generalls: and yet now all that reade the ſcurrilous Pamphlets, or are but a little familiar with them, ſhall hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but revilings againſt the whole Nation of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and traducing of all our gallant Commanders, to whom next under God, we owe moſt of that good we now enjoy, and hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to enjoy. I lay nothing to their charge, but that every man that is acquainted with them can witneſſe. I know not any one Ordinance the Parliament maketh that pleaſeth them; but for that pious Ordinance they lately ſet forth, concerning the ſilencing of all ſuch Preachers and teachers as were not for knowledge and ſoundneſſe of doctrine thought fit to inſtruct the people: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the prudent Councell ſhewed the religious care they had of the peoples good, and for which they ought ever to be had in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: this Ordinance I ſay ſo diſpleaſed the generality of the Independents, as they brake out into contumelious ſpeeches, ſome of them affirming, that the High Court of Parliament was worſe then that of the High Commiſſion, and thoſe of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: others of them in diſcontent ſaid, that the recruting of the Army had ſtood the ſtate in an hundred thouſand pounds; and by this new Ordinance, the whole Army would ſpeedily be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for now all the brave Commanders of the Independents would lay aſide their Armes, and leave the wars. It ſeemes that all the Independent Officers, went rather to preach than to ſight, and to ſet up their new Lights and vent their new doctrines, then to exerciſe their valour; by which it may evidently appear that all the projects of the Independents, in getting prime places by Sea and Land, and in the Armies and in the Towns, Cities, Forts, and Caſtles, and all other places and in all Committees; is onely for the advancement and fomenting of their faction, and this I conceive to be the onely cauſe of all the liney-woley Committees through the Kingdome, by reaſon of which no hereſie nor novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in opinion or religion can be ſuppreſt, where they are joyned in Commiſſion; nor no true heroicall vertue be rewarded in any by their good wills, but in thoſe of their faction, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well paid and grow brave and rich ſuddenly, and are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, when other noble Spirits and brave men, are caſhered and outed that have done excellent ſervice. But the Independents
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:158558:52"/>perceiving that that Ordinance of the Parliament would be ſome hinderance to their deſigne, they moſt temerariouſly and unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully traduced the great Councell for it, as they alwayes have done whatſoever hath been performed by our gallant Generalls, either by Sea or Land that were not of their faction, which was ever accounted as a thing of nothing amongſt them: and whatſoever the <hi>Scots</hi> have done, it is made but little and not worth the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of; and they affirm that all the <hi>Scots</hi> have done, was for their own ends: as if the Independents ever did any thing but for their own ends, or as if ever any man did any thing of labour or danger, that among other brave intentions that he might have, he aymed not alſo at his own ends; or as if the Labourer tooke not paines for his hire, which was his own ends; or as if any went to war, but for both honour &amp; pay, as well as for the defence of himſelf and Country; and as if the Saints themſelves ſuch as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was, had not the eye of their faith, next unto Gods glory, to the recompence of reward; or as if any brave men might not fight for their own ends, with the preſervation of their Country: and yet there is nothing more common in the Independents mouths againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and againſt all our Heroicall men, then that they have all their own ends, and ſo have all the Independents, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value all other mens both abilities and actions, to advance their own ends &amp; to ſtrengthen their party, as all men may eaſily gather by all their proceedings; for if at any time God gives any victory, where in compariſon of the reſt there is but a very handfull of them in the Army, then they aſſume all the glory of this action to themſelves, that their Faction may be magnified amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And if there happen any ill ſucceſſe unto any Army in which there is any companies of the Independents, then all the fault muſt be laid upon all the other gallant Generals and Commanders, to the very obſcuring and darkning of their reputation, and taking away of all the honour their former actions had juſtly merited. And I have ever obſerved, that in all ſucceſſefull imployments where any of their Commanders have been, all the glory is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Independents, and is ever ſet forth with all manner of expreſſions of Rhetorick, and that in every Pamphlet (for fear it ſhould be forgot) as if the ſafety of all the kingdome depended upon them, and as if they had done all; and that all the other Commanders had done nothing, or not any thing worth the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:158558:52"/>thinking of or ſpeaking of; and all this to bring their own faction into a high eſteeme, and make all the other Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to be ſlighted, or not valued in compariſon of themſelves. For my ſelf, I ſhall ever give any Commander of that faction his due praiſes, for any good he ſhall doe unto his countrey by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and skill; yet he muſt give me leave ever to render the prime glory of any victory or deliverance to God, and to look upon the means in the ſecond place, whoſoever they be that God makes the inſtruments of it. And yet I muſt tell the Independents, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes them much to re-gaine their reputation, and to doe good ſervice by their valour for their countrey; for the gallant men in the Kings Army, before the battell in Yorkſhire, had never any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the valour of the Independents, and would often ſay, that they were beholding to them for <hi>Briſtoll, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and many other places that followed by reaſon of the loſing of them: and it is thought by the judiciouſeſt men in both the Armies, that if thoſe Townes had not been loſt, the warres would have been at an end before this time. Now whether all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were loſt by the valour of the Independent party, or by their cowardize rather, I leave that to the conſideration of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents themſelves, who may alwayes ſet thoſe Townes before their eyes, to put them upon brave atchievements, for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and redeeming of their reputation; and if it ſhall pleaſe God to make them inſtruments of re-gaining all thoſe fortified Cities and places into the Parliaments hands, though it will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the loſſe that is come upon the whole Kingdome by it, yet all that wiſh well unto their countrey will give them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and applauſe that ſuch a noble action can challenge at any gratefull peoples hands and mouthes: but I ſhall ever deſire the Independents not to ſacrifice unto their own nets, and to aſcribe the glory unto themſelves, as they have too often done to my knowledge: and therefore I wiſh them rather frequently to reade the 9. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where the Lord giveth a ſpeciall charge unto his people, that they ſhould not ſay it was for their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that God had given them the victory over their enemies at any time, and this caution was thrice reiterated in the ſame Chapter, to teach them and in them all people to give God the glory of all victories, who goes before his people as he is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of their Armies as a <hi>conſuming fire;</hi> and that it is not their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:158558:53"/>Bow, nor the Sword, that procures victory without God go out before their Hoaſts to conquer and deſtroy; let them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceive that any victory was given to them for their owne righteouſneſſe, much leſſe for their Independency, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould ſo puffe up themſelves and ſo clamour amongſt the people, what ſervice they had done to the State, becauſe ſome of the Independents ſtood to it in the battell of <hi>York,</hi> when other of them ran away: for they ran as well as others, and if they be not lyars, all the other Independents had ran away too and left the field if they had knowne what had hapned in the other parts of the Army; but they being ignorant of what was done, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of a mighty party, came on with the more animoſity, and God gave them the victory, and to God in the firſt place belongs the glory of that action: and our brethren the Independents might have had a great deale more honour then they had, had they not ſo vilified all the other Armies, and applauded themſelves, to ſtrengthen their faction and make their party more great and powerfull; that then they may in time be maſters of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and give lawes to them all, who we know they bear as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall a hatred to, as the very Papiſts and Cavaliers; as all their words, preachings, and Pamphlets witneſſe; for their malice it is notoriouſly known, and it is ſo exceeding great, as it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every day againſt any that but diſſent from them in opinion; and their very looks ſhew it, for moſt of them carry envie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in their faces towards the Presbyterians, ſo that I can ſpeak by my own experience, I know not any Independent in England (a Kinſman of mine and his Wife excepted that was alwayes a true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> and through their hypocriſie miſlead) that do not as maliciouſly and implacably hate the Presbyterians as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talleſt enemies they have in the world: and as for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I could not hitherto, being in any of their companies (ſince they perfectly knew my reſolution) enjoy the very lawes of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongſt them; ſo that I have been both privately &amp; publickly reproached by them, without offending of them in thought, word, and deed: by which I may boldly conclude it is a meer faction, and the moſt Phariſaicall, proud, envious, and malitious Sect that ever ſprung up: for they hate all the Presbyterians for no other cauſe but that they differ from them in opinion; which neither the old Browniſts nor the ancient Anabaptiſts either did or do: for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:158558:53"/>they are the ſame to me that ever they were when we were fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, many of which were by the Prelates caſt into the Gatehouſe where I lay, and they neither then nor now thought the worſe of me for my differing opinion from them, but at this day ſhew me the ſame curteſie when I either go to them or they come to me, that ever they did; and have defended me often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Independents, when they rayled of me that I was a Presbyterian: and affirmed to their knowledge that I had ever been of that minde ſince they knew me, and that was as they ſaid twenty years; and they told them they ſaw no reaſon, I ſhould not be left to the liberty of my conſcience as well as they were to theirs, neither did they ſee any cauſe why the Independens ſhould be offended with any that differ'd from them; and all this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts and the Browniſts have ſpoken in my behalfe: ſo that a man may well perceive thoſe poore people do what they do out of a conſcientious ignorance; and that the Independents doe all out of an arrogant faction, who are as cunning as Gypſies, and all to make a party, by which they may attaine to their own ends, which I am afraid will tend to the ruine of us all if the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not. And I am the more induced to believe it, becauſe I ſee all their preaching tends to faction: for at ſome times (ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable they are) they would ſeem in their Sermons to be as meek as Lambes, and they tell the people how glad they ſhould be of a good agreement and accommodation between us, and then they relate unto them alſo that the difference is very little, and ſo ſmall, that one would wonder that there ſhould be ſuch a contention, and ſo great a feud about it, &amp; this they ſpeak in great Aſſemblies. Now let all men conſider the genious of theſe Independents. They make the difference very little. What contentious ſpirited men then are theſe that go about to make a faction through three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, yea through the world, for that which they proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a thing of nothing? And notwithſtanding what they have preacht but a Sermon before in a moderate way, in another Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are all fire and toe, ſpeaking nothing but Daggers and daring; and all their diſcourſe tends to no other end but to ſtrengthen their faction &amp; to ſet up Independency, and to exaſperate the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Presbyterians as ſo many <hi>Eſaus</hi> &amp; Perſecutors. And for ought I can underſtand, their private meetings tend to nothing elſe but to ſtrengthen their party, where they ordinarily pray for the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:158558:54"/>of the Presbyterians, of whom they uſually ſay, if there be any children of the Devill in the Kingdome, they are the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians; and one of their fat Paſtors not long ſince, in one of their Conventicles amongſt his joyned Members, being in his prayer, brake out into this expreſſion; <hi>We bleſſe thy name, holy Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou hast kept us hither to out of the hands of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> meaning the Presbyterians, who they look on like ſo many Perſecutors and <hi>Eſau's,</hi> out of whoſe hands <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed God to deliver him: ſo that their uncharitableneſſe is ſeen in their very prayers. And nothing, as I ſaid before, pleaſeth theſe men more then to hear of any breaches amongſt the Presbyterians, and of differences betwixt Nation and Nation, and of the multiplication of their faction: for not long ſince in one of their private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where they pray for the ſubverſion of the Presbyterians, one of their ſociety ſaid unto an Independent Miniſter, that was come to officiate amongſt them, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will tell you ſome newes;</hi> What is that, replyed he? <hi>There were Letters intercepted going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scotland from ſome of the Committee of that Nation, wherein they made a great complaint, that Independency daily increaſed in England, and that there was mighty multitudes of them in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and through the kingdome. Oh brave</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>oh brave. Nay,</hi> ſaith the other, <hi>I will tell you more. What is that?</hi> replyed the Gentleman, <hi>The Scots and the Engliſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are like to go together by the eares, about the ſhipping and coales of Newcaſtle. Better and better,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>now it begins to work.</hi> So that whereas <hi>David</hi> ſaid, What a joyfull thing it is to ſee Brethren live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity, theſe Independents rejoyce and glory to ſee and hear when Brethren are like to fall together by the eares. And therefore if ſuch as theſe be men of God, or Angels ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they are much unlike and different from that Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto the Paſtors in the ſecond of <hi>Luke,</hi> who after they had preached unto them the good tydings of great joy, in their Doxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and praiſing of God, they ſaid, <hi>Glory vnto God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, and good will towards men.</hi> But the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents rejoyce at ill-will amongſt men, and at diviſions and wars and that among chriſtian-brethren.</p>
            <p>And a great man of that fraternity, not many moneths ſince, in a Knights Chamber, gloried to me, as of a matter of triumph, to think they had hindred the work of Reformation thus long; <hi>Ye ſee</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:158558:54"/>(ſaith he) <hi>that a little handfull of Independent Miniſters in the Synod, have given three Kingdomes imployment theſe two yeares, ſo that they can do nothing:</hi> and boaſted of this wicked act as a matter of vantation and triumph. So that if men well conſider the whole negotiation of the Independents in the Reverend Aſſembly, it is to hinder the work of reformation; then the which there cannot be a more diabolicall deſigne. And then they ſpread it abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, that they have not liberty to ſpeak, when it is moſt notorious, that one of them ſpeaks more than half a dozen of the other Miniſters. And they have publiſhed it alſo all over the Town, that the Presbyterians durſt not let their reaſons be ſet out in Print, to the view of the world, for they knew very well, that as they were unanſwerable, ſo that all the people would forthwith have been of their judgement; and by this their babble it is incredible how they have ſtrengthned their Faction, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſciples, for their followers beleeve all they ſay as Goſpell. And truely, if there were nothing but theſe their under-hand dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and malicious practiſes, and rejoycing at evill, it were enough to make all men abhor their wayes; but the truth is, they have no certainty in any thing they beleeve to day, and by their practiſes they contradict all their doctrine and tenents. And that all men may be yet a little better acquainted with the Independent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters juglings, I thought good to inſert here theſe ſixteen Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſent me by a learned and godly Gentleman, who is very well verſt in all their doctrines and manners: They are theſe.</p>

            <p>Out of all the which, as out of my former diſcourſe, it is eaſie for any man to gather, that of all the Seducers that have yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the world, theſe are moſt to be taken heed of, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeeming holineſſe they may make ſhew of to the people.
